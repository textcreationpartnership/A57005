            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>HEre thou haſt a large Diſpenſatory, or, if thou wilt, the Univerſal Doctrine of the Medicinal Art; which yet ſcarce was ever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted into one Work, or digeſted into an exact Method, as to make the Art perfect. This, I ſay, is the firſt-born of Curative Medicine, which I may term, <hi>The Phyſicians Right-hand,</hi> or <hi>Skilful Artificer;</hi> not onely preparing Salutiferous Antidotes, but alſo directing how they ſhould be exhibited and applyed; demonſtrating Salubrious Remedies for the curing of every Malady: To thee therefore <hi>(Courteous Reader)</hi> have I dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated theſe my Labours; endeavouring to purge the whole Body of Phar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy from the <hi>Errata</hi>'s of the Ancient Graecians; and alſo, from the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity of the Idiome of many other Barbarous Nations, that have been fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous for Phyſicians; and have compiled the abſtract of all into this Method, which I hope I may term, The moſt abſolute of any yet extant.</p>
            <p>Though I am not ignorant, that there are many Books extant in Latine, that handle the Pharmaceutical Art, which <hi>Fernelius</hi> hath augmented by many Precepts, <hi>Sylvius</hi> illuſtrated with ſeveral Preparations, <hi>Rondeletius</hi> with Compoſitions, and <hi>Wekerus</hi> with Confections; yet (without oſtenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion do I ſpeak it) none but may modeſtly be reproved; each deſcribing many Compound Medicaments, whoſe Simples they knew not, neither could they render a Reaſon or Method of the Compoſition. I have not here preſcribed any thing, but that both the aforeſaid Scruples may be ſatisfied; neither can any doubt (how ignorant ſoever he be) how to ſelect, prepare, and min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle his Simples, becauſe theſe things are clearly enough demonſtrated and explained, not onely from my own particular knowledge, but from the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſeſt Phyſicians in <hi>Paris</hi> (of which I acknowledge my ſelf the leaſt) which may contend with the greateſt part of <hi>Europe,</hi> for the ableſt Doctors in Phyſick: for as many Phyſicians as there be, ſo many Oracles, ſo many <hi>Apollo</hi>'s, ſo many Princes in Phyſick, which have made famous the Art, both by Teaching and Curing; ſparing no Pains nor Coſt to adorn <hi>Lutetia</hi> with merited Renown: for ſcarce have our Colleagues any ſpare hours alotted from their quotidian Avocations to the viſiting of the Sick.</p>
            <p>Yet notwithſtanding the preſſure of my Imployments in particular, and defatigable diuturnal Labours, I have endeavoured to illuſtrate the Phar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maceutical Art, in this Method thou now ſeeſt it in.</p>
            <p>The whole Work is divided into two Parts: the firſt contains Pharma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceutical Inſtitutions, or the Theorical part of Pharmacy; the latter, An
<pb facs="tcp:37350:17"/>Apothecaries Shop, or Practical part of Phyſick: Between theſe two, are contained three Books of Medicinal Materials, which are, as it were, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient to them both; demonſtrating ſuch matter as the Inſtitutions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, and explaining ſuch as is expedient to be uſed in the Shop; which I have ſo placed, that thereby every Simple which ingredes the Compoſitions, may be dignoted in its nature and quality.</p>
            <p>Now in the firſt Book of the Inſtitutions, is handled the manner of Elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Medicaments; in the ſecond, the preparation; in the third, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition; in the fourth, the Rules to be obſerved in Compounding them; and in the fifth, the Forms of Remedies are preſcribed. To theſe are ſubjoyned other three Books, treating of Plants, Minerals, and Animals: and laſtly, The Shop, or Antidotary, divided into Two Parts; the firſt Treating of Medicines to be inwardly taken; the latter, of ſuch as are to be outwardly applyed: which are again divided into three Books; and ſubdivided into ſeveral Sections, by reaſon of the variety of the matter handled, and for the more elegant diſpoſing of the Method preſcribed. All which (Good Reader) I deſire thee kindely to accept of; and what I have delivered, to take in good part. <hi>Farewel.</hi>

                        <p>AS a Chirurgeon takes his denomination from his Vocation,
<note place="margin">Chirurgus quis dicatur, quid praestat.</note> or Art, whereby he cures external diſtempers dexterouſly, quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſafely, and eaſily: ſo doth the Pharmacopoean derive his name from the Phyſick which he makes, or rather aptly compounds into a convenient Medicine. So alſo is the Druggiſt nominated from thoſe Simples and Drugs he ſels; as the Apothecary from the Apothectes, or Shop where his Medicines are placed; who in times paſt was called a Seplaſiary, from <hi>Seplaſia,</hi> a Market-place in <hi>Capua,</hi> where the beſt odoriferous Unguents are made. But theſe names are often uſed indiſtinctly, and the concertation about the bare denomination, is vain and frivolous, when the ſubſtance is in handling.</p>
                        <p>Probity is not ſo requiſite in a Philoſopher as an Apothecary,

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:37350:34"/>either out of malice or ignorance; ſo that if <hi>Hippocrates</hi> be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt and upright, it's no matter if <hi>Socrates</hi> be a Knave.</p>
                        <p>But firſt of all,
<note place="margin">What conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecary ought to be of.</note> an Apothecary ought to be a Lover of Piety, one that fears God, voyd of Envy and Malice, of a found judgement, well skilled in Grammar, of a good competency; not covetous, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient of labour, of great induſtry, not given to corpulency and epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curiſm, one that makes conſcienceof his actions; for an Atheiſt, as he doth not reſpect the Creator, ſo neither the Creature; and an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious man repines at another mans good; and a fooliſh man hath an inſeparable property in him, <hi>viz.</hi> a deſire to hurt; and the unskilfull thinks nothings right but what he doth himſelf; and the covetous man is good to nooe, worſt to himſelf; and a poor man is eaſily cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, for need will compell him to deal diſtoneſtry.</p>
                        <p>They alſo are unworthy of the name and dignity of the Profeſſion, who are by natural jaclination Scoffers, Drunkards, Jeſters, Volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, Frroneous, Garrulous, Impoſtors, Jugglers, Day lurkers, and Deceivers, who with gilded pretences do deceive the Vulgar with trifles, guiles, boaſtings, vain promiſes, adulation, and lyes, cheat them of their moneys, deprive them of their health, and by their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion bring their lives in jeopardy. Therefore nothingis more noxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the Republick, of a greater ſtain and blemiſh to the honour of the Profeſſion, and ſcandalous to good Letters, than theſe kinde of men, who ought to be eſchewed as the vileſt of Creatures, and their company avoyded as peſtilentious.</p>
                        <p>But whereas the ſubject of Pharmacy and Medicine is all one, <hi>viz.</hi> mans body, as it is capable of health or ſickneſs, the Phyſician and Apothecary ought to participate of many good qualities, as pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, experience, diligence, and knowledge of Medicaments.</p>

<note n="[o]" place="margin">Lactucae medicamentum eſſe poteſt, Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum &amp; ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenum.</note> Lettice unſeaſonably, and in too great a quantity adminiſtred, may as eaſily kill as Hemlock; it is both nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment and poyſon, accordingly as 'tis uſed.

                        </head>
                        <p>THE whole Man is a whole Diſeaſe, ſaith <hi>Hippocrates, (Epiſt. ad Damog.)</hi> for ſuch is he when he proceeds into the world from the inquination of the wombe, that he is ready for the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician, by reaſon of his imperfections and diſeaſes which he is liable to, either as a conſequent from the diſſent of the four qualities, or from the ill uſe of ſuch things which Nature appointed for nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but through the abuſe thereof cauſes innumerable Diſeaſes in the Body; which the medicinal Art (out of a due obſervation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of) doth infallibly either prevent or cure, either by the preſcript of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:37350:35"/>a wholſome Diet, or by Medicaments, either internally aſſumed, or externally applyed, as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> deſcribes; <hi>Lib. de diata, &amp; Gal. de ſanis.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And theſe are either ſimple, which for the moſt part <hi>Hippocrates</hi> uſed, or compounded according to Art; they are called Simples, which remain, and are as Nature produced them; as Caſſia, Rha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barb, Polipody, Colocynth, with many others, which have onely ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained their natural compoſition of the four Elements. But they are called Compounds, which conſiſt of many Simples of divers virtues noited together by Art and Induſtry.</p>
                        <p>Now a Medicament differs from Aliment,
<note place="margin">Medicamentum quid.</note> thus: for that is called a Medicament, which being either internally aſſumed, or externally applyed, can work an alteration in our bodyes, as Pepper, Euphor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bium, Pelitory, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>And that is called Aliment,
<note place="margin">Alimentum quid.</note> which internally aſſumed, doth nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh and augment the body, as Bread, Wine, the fleſh of all flying and four footed Creatures, except ravenous and rapacious; for thoſe Creatures that live by rape, are of an evil humour, and engender ill blood, and are to be rejected as unclean. And therefore in Divine Writ, the Iſraelites were forbidden to eat either Eagle, Vulture, Griffon, Raven, Hawk, or the like; and we, according to this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Decree, do prudently abſtain from the fleſh of Foxes, Wolves, Lyons, and ſuch rapacious Creatures.</p>
                        <p>Now the medium between both,
<note place="margin">Alimentum medicamento<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum.</note> is a medicinal Aliment, which ſympathetically partakes of both natures; for it partly nouriſheth, and partly altereth the body, as Lettice, Radiſh root, Gourd, Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, and many ſuch like. As there is betwixt Aliment and Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment a certain medium, ſo alſo is there betwixt Nutriment and Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; for the one preſerveth, refreſheth, and augmenteth; the other deſtroyes, kils, and corrupts; betwixt both there is a Medicament, which doth effect neither.</p>

                           <hi>GAlen</hi> obſerves out of <hi>Hippocrates, Lib. de Elem.</hi> that a man could never be ſick, if he conſiſted onely of one Element, for then every mans Nature would be one, the Effect one, the Cauſe of his return to his natural ſtation one. But now the abſurdity lyes in this, that whereas the ſpecies of diſeaſes are infinite, ſo alſo the reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:37350:35"/>both ſimple and compound, that are to be appropriated there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, are almoſt influmerable.</p>
                        <p>Thoſe Medicaments that are compounded, and yet fearmed ſimple, are but comparatively and improperly ſo ſtiled, in as much as they are referred to others more compound, as <hi>Oximel ſimplex, Diapru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num ſimplex,</hi> and the like: but the Roſe, Endive, Pſantain, Mine, Wormwood, and all kinde of Vegetables that are created, which have received no compoſition or mixture by Art, are properly called Simples by Phyſicians; which they ſometimes uſe alone, as the juice of Plantain for aſtringent Lotions; the juice of Water Lillies <hi>ad E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryſipileta,</hi> or St. <hi>Anthonies</hi> fire; the juice of Betony the Canker, with which it hath an admirable ſympathy; the juice of Vine-ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs, by <hi>Galens</hi> advice, againſt the Shingles; the freſh or meat of Quinces, applyed plaiſterwiſe to the region of the ſtomack, againſt choler, and aſſumed againſt the bloody flux, the body being firſt purged; as alſo Betony againſt <hi>Cephalalgia;</hi> as almoſt all Plants to the expelling of moſt Diſeaſes.</p>
                        <p>That which is recorded of many Plants exceeds credit, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce admirable effects; for the root of Peony applyed to the head, or hung about the neck, doth cure the Epilepſy; Mint put into milk hinders its coagulation and condenſation into Cheeſe, as it hath been proved by men of good credit.</p>

                        <p>The Author of <hi>Libri ſanitatis</hi> doth aver with <hi>Tribius,</hi> that the Bird called <hi>Pye,</hi> ſhutting the orifice of her neſt, can cauſe the doors to fly open onely by the touch of a certain herb; ſome attribute this vertue onely to the Bird, others to the herb. <hi>Theophraſtus,</hi> a moſt skilfull Herbaliſt, makes mention of a certain herb, which ſo powerfully pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vokes to Luſtfull Couplation, that if the Noble Author ſpeaks true, it is more than credible that Nature hath devoted this to the cold and weak conſtitutions, as the Nymphea to the lecherous.</p>

                           <hi>Clymenum rubrum,</hi> or Pile wort,
<note place="margin">Herba Ficeria.</note> hath ſuch power in curing the Piles, that whoſo carries with him the root of this herb, ſhall be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved ſafe from this Diſeaſe.

And that which was moſt wonderfull, it cured Mad men, and Demomacks; which when the Inhabitants adjoyning perceived, they very diſcreetly tyed a Dog faſt to it, which incited or compelled by hunger, or called upon, with much ſtruggling pulled up the Plant.</p>

<note place="margin">Contrario con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarium Deus opponit.</note> for he oppoſes one Contrary to another, and one Diſſentany to another.

                        <p>It will not be beyond our ſcope here to take notice of the various natures of Plants; for ſome are green, and flouriſh in the middle of Winter, as Wolfs-bane, and black Hellebor; other Plants in the Equinoctial, or Spring tide; others in the heat of Summer, and ſome in Autumn; at which time all others are, for the moſt or greateſt part, deprived both of leaves and flowers.</p>

                        <p>THE principal differences of medicinal Ingredients, as well for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign as domeſtick, are taken either from their matter or facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.

                        <p>In the firſt genus are contained all kinds of Plants,
<note place="margin">Medicamenta en plantis ſumpta.</note> their ſeveral parts, and what is deduced from them, as roots, barks, ſtalks, woods, boughs, leaves, flowers, fruits, ſeeds, gums, roſins, juices, drops, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors, miſſel-dews, moſſes, cottens, nuts.</p>
                        <p>In the ſecond are contained the Elements themſelves, as Fire, Flame, Smoke; Air, ſerene, or turbid, hot, cold, moyſt, or dry; Water, pleaſant, ſalt, winy, ſaltiſh, clammy, ſulphurous, taſting of Nitre, Braſs or Iron; all kinds of Earth, as <hi>Bole, Terra Lemnia, Mellitea, Chymolia, Rubrica, Ampelitis, Erithrea, Ochra, Creta,</hi> and in a word, all Minerals which are digged out of the Bowels of the Earth; as the ſeveral kinds of Stones, as the <hi>Lapis Ethites, Cyaneus, ſeu Lazuli,
<note place="margin">Metalla ſeptem.</note> Judaicus;</hi> as alſo Metals, which are acknowledged by
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:37350:36"/>all to be ſeven, Gold, Silver, Tin, Lead, Iron, Copper, and Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilver, according to the number of the Planets, whence according to the <hi>Spagyrians,</hi> they borrow their names. Theſe alſo are improperly referred to the Minerals, <hi>Biſtumen Petrol,</hi> all kinds of Salts, Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanth, and Amber.</p>
                        <p>In the third genus are contained all Animals, whether Integrals,
<note place="margin">Medicamenta ex animalibus ſumpta.</note> or In-parts. Integrals, as an old Cock in pottage, to make the belly laxative, and to nouriſh the body; a Swallow eaten, for to quicken the eye ſight; a roaſted Lark, againſt the Collick; Crab fiſhes, for ſuch as are in Conſumptions; old Scorpions, againſt their bitings; Cantharides, for Ruptures.</p>
                        <p>Parts of Animals, as the brains of Sparrows againſt <hi>Stimulum ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neris,</hi> Hairs brain, againſt Tooth-ach in Children, Fox lungs againſt the conſumption of the Lungs, Wolfs liver againſt the conſumption of the Liver, an Aſſes liver againſt the Epilepſy, the inteſtines of a Wolf againſt the Collick paſſions, the back of <hi>Stinci marini</hi> againſt the ſtifneſs of the Yard, Goats blood againſt the Stone, Partridge or Kites gall to clear the eyes, <hi>Cran.

                        <p>There are alſo yet many other parts of Animals, whence Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are aſſumed, as Marrow, Suet, the fat of Calves, Harts, Hogs, Kids, Ducks, Capons and Geeſe, the milk of Women, Aſſes, and Sheep, Cheeſe, Butter, Curds, Cream, Whey, Butter-milk, Hens eggs, Fiſh-ſhels, the hairs and other excrements of Animals, which we particularly preſcribe in the compoſition of Medicaments in our <hi>Pharmacopoeia.</hi>

<note place="margin">Aloes facultas.</note> for Aloes hath a faculty of purging, corroborating the Ventricle, killing and expelling Worms, and exiccating the humours of the head.</p>

<note place="margin">Tertia medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentorum alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantium.</note> in matter or form; whence ariſe three kinds of alterative Medicaments; firſt, that which impenſly heats, cools, moyſtneth, or dryeth; ſecondly, that which changeth the commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration and conſiſtency of the matter: ſo as either too much to obdurate or mollify, too much to rarify or condenſe, too much to bind or looſe, too much to thicken or attenuate; thirdly, which cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupteth or weakneth the ſubſtance or form it ſelf, ſuch as beſides their manifeſt quality, whereby they heat, erode, refrigerate, or ſtupify, by a certain occult propriety, and ſo deſtroy the ſubſtance it ſelf, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce corruption with nauſcouſneſs, as <hi>Cicuta, Anchora, Napellas, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conitum, Sublimatum,</hi> and many more; ſome are noxious to the whole body, as the fore-named; others to certain peculiar parts, as the Sea-hare to the Lungs, Cantharides to the Bladder, Wolfs-bane to the Womb, Hemlock to the Brain.</p>
                        <p>The roborative,
<note place="margin">Roborativum quid.</note> or as vulgarly tearmed, ſtrengthening Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is that which with or by a certain propriety reſpects Corrobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, and conſerves ſome part of our body, as Cephalick medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to the head, Otick to the ears, Ophthalmick to the eyes, Oden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick to the teeth, Stomatick to the mouth, Stomachick to the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack, Cordial to the heart, Hepatick to the liver, Splenetick to the ſpleen, Nephritick to the reins, Hyſterick to the belly, Nervical to nerves; of which or moſt ſhall be ſpoken to in their places.</p>
                        <p>The Cathartick or purgative Medicament is that which extracts a vitious and excrementious humour out of the body.
<note place="margin">Catharticum quid proprie.</note> Now that which promiſcuouſly and generally expels all humours out of the body, cannot truly be called purgative, as <hi>Antimonium, Cataputia major,</hi> and the like, but ſuch as educes and purges proper and congruent hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, to which its faculty is directed and ordained; for thoſe more violent Medicaments do often precipitate us to death, of which <hi>Galen</hi> ſpeaks, when he

                        <p>WHereas ſimple Medicaments have often two, ſometimes three faculties incorporated, we will ſpeak of them in order. The firſt is called Simple and Elementary, which ariſes from the commixtion of the four Elements. The ſecond, ſubſtantial or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial, which proceeds from a commoderation and conſiſtency of the matter, in which the four qualities inhere in a divers proportion. And there is ſomething found beſides theſe, a third, namely purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, which <hi>Fernelius</hi> calls an occult quality. And <hi>Sylvius,</hi> with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of no mean knowledge, affirm four qualities to be univerſally reſident in ſome Medicament, whereof he aſſerts the third to be little known, and the fourth altogether unknown, yet both theſe are often taken for one and the ſame: for whatever Medicament acts by any inexplicable, or not ſufficiently perſpicuous property, not proceeding from the firſt or ſecond qualities, are ſaid to act from the third qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, or property of the whole ſubſtance, or occult virtue.</p>
                        <p>The firſt faculty of Medicaments is common,
<note place="margin">The firſt qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caments.</note> and as it were the Baſis of the reſt, proceeding immediately from the Elements them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and it conſiſts chiefly in calefaction, refrigeration, moyſtning, or drying; in every of which it is ſeen either obſcurely, as when it acts in the firſt degree; or apparently, as in the ſecond; or vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently, as in the third; or perfectly, as in the fourth; and that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the beginning, middle, or end of every one:
<note place="margin">The ſeveral qualities of Medicaments.</note> ſo that there are twelve orders of hot, cold, moyſt and dry Medicaments, which take place amongſt them that have conjugated faculties, which are either hot and moyſt, or hot and dry, or cold and dry; for they produce theſe faculties not onely obſcurely, manifeſtly, vehemently, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly, but alſo gradually, and that either in the beginning, middle, or end of their operation.</p>
                        <p>The ſecond qualities are concomitants of the firſt, Elementary or ſimple, by whoſe help it is that they exiſt and manifeſt their virtues; for the faculty of Apertion, Rarefaction, Attraction, Attenuation, follows Calefaction; the faculties of Craſſitude, Denſity, Occlu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and Repulſion, follow Refrigeration; of Mollification follows Moyſture; the faculty of Induration follows Siccity, for Siccity ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>durates,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:37350:38"/>as it is plain with Clay hardned by the North winde, or Summers heat, and brick with fire. As alſo Humidity mollifies, while any moderate heat perſeveres; for the moyſture of Ice becomes hard, becauſe it wants heat.</p>
                        <p>The ſecond virtues and qualities are alſo apparent in auſtere, ſharp, tart, bitter, opening, attenuating, reſolving, contracting, repelling, mollifying, and caſing Medicaments; and do as evidently perform their operation, as the firſt or elementary qualities.</p>

                        <p>NOW beſides the firſt and ſecond qualities, there is a third; which being occult, and inexplicable, no certain account can be rendred of it, nor yet any exact knowledge thereof be apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, but is known onely by experience. For why, the Jaſper ſtone, ſaith <hi>Galen,</hi> by touching the wound, ſhould ſtop the flux of blood, I know not; and if I knew perfectly how to find out the nature of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing particularly, I ſhould think my ſelf ſuch an one as I do conceive <hi>Eſculapius</hi> was. But ſome properties can neither be known nor explained; for no man can bring any firm and invincible argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or reaſon, why thoſe Spaniſh flyes, or Cantharides, ſhould vex the bladder with an inflammation, or hot diſpoſition, being applyed far from it;
<note place="margin">The property of Sea-crabs.</note> or why the aſhes of Crabs, being of a drying nature, ſhould have ſuch an admirable property againſt the biting of mad Dogs; or why, being mixed with Gentian or Frankincenſe, it ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates better and more effectually than with other Medicaments.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Galen</hi> admiring the never failing ſucceſs of this Medicament, bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied himſelf no little, to finde out the cauſe why, and at length pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to publiſh a Book concerning thoſe things that act by an occuit property; but performed not his promiſe, perchance fearing leſt it might detract from his great Fame, if he ſhould relinquiſh his Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe imperfect, or not ſatisfie himſelf or his Readers, if he did not with his accuſtomed learning and dexterity repleniſh and accompliſh it.
<note place="margin">The extent of the third fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty.</note> Yet this third faculty is very ample, containing under it Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, curing diſtempers by a certain occult virtue, having reſpect to certain peculiar parts, of which we intend to diſcourſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly.
<note place="margin">There is in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liments an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>explicable quality.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>Neither do we acknowledge this inexplicable property to conſiſt ſolely in Medicaments and Poyſons, whereby the one cures, and the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:37350:38"/>other kils, and ſometimes expels diſeaſes: but alſo in Aliments, which repair the loſs of ſtrength by that continual <hi>Effluvium;</hi> for many abhor many meats, which others take with a greedy appetite; which though at firſt they are unlike, yet after many concoctions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come like and proper to our bodyes; whence ariſeth a great ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude betwixt the thing nouriſhing, and that which is nouriſhed, which ſcarce can be defined; and why this man is more delighted with this meat, and that with another. The eating of fiſh and fleſh is familiar to our whole Nation, yet have we known many, faith <hi>Amatus Lucia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> who altogether abſtained from eating of fleſh; and others,
<note place="margin">Hiſtoria notatu dign.</note> to whom not onely the eating, but alſo the very ſmell of Cheeſe was as poyſon. Another have we known, a Spaniard by Nation, who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver taſted of Fiſh, but when he was invited by his Friend once to a Supper, and had eaten Eggs, with which the aſhes of dryed Fiſh was cunningly mixed, he fell into ſuch a pain and anguiſh by vomiting, that he was almoſt killed thereby. The ſame famous Author alſo ſaw another, a Venetian Monk, in whom the ſmell of Roſes would cauſe Madneſs; which alſo I have obſerved in a Noble Lady. And <hi>Julius Scaliger,</hi> in a learned Cardinal, as he affirms in his Exerciſes againſt <hi>Cardan, viz. (Exercit</hi> 153. <hi>part.</hi> 10.) where he commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates a certain woman of excellent virtue and beauty, named <hi>Francis,</hi> who could by no means be perſwaded, before ſhe was fourteen years of age, to eat Fleſh. He affirms alſo, that one of his Children as much abhorred Cabbages, as himſelf did the Creſſons. As alſo a maid in the City <hi>Mediolim</hi> dyed with a draught of <hi>Caſſia fiſtula;</hi> for every mans peculiar appetite is proper to himſelf; and many eſchew Wint as Poyſon, others adore it as their God.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, this inexplicable occult faculty is obſerved in the food of other Animals. For who by reaſon can declare why the Oſtrich delights in Iron? why the Hart deſires Serpents; the Bear, Ants; the Aſs, <hi>Ferula.</hi> Some Animals live onely by fiſhing, others by hunting, others by Corn, others by the natural increaſe of Plants. The Mallet devours the bird Hirron; the Beaver, little Fiſhes; the Hawk, the Eagle, and Fox, are nouriſhed and fed upon little Birds; the Hen, the Partridge, and the Horſe, on Corn; the Oxe, Deer, and Hart, on little Plants, or their tender parts. And why theſe do delight and grow fat rather with that Aliment than this, and thoſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with this than that, cannot eaſily be explained by reaſon. For the Vulture will ſooner periſh with Faraine, than touch Wheat; the Pheaſant rather dye, than eat by ſtealth.</p>

                        <head>CHAP. IX. <hi>Of the faculty of purging Medicaments, whence it proceeds, and how it operates.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p>THE diſquiſition of the faculty of purging Medicaments hath been the exerciſe of many ingenious men; and yet neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, as many men as have endeavoured after its knowledge, ſo many ſeveral opinions have they left to us their Poſterity. The Alcumiſts not without ſome pains endeavour to demonſtrate, that it proceeds from the ſaltneſs of the Compounds; for they lay down this for a general Axiom, that all Salts are purgative. Others maintain, that this faculty is altogether occult, not apparently explicable by reaſon. There are others who judge, that it ariſes from the ſpecial tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the mixture, or compound. Others look upon it as a fifth quality. <hi>Meſue</hi> would have its original in Heaven, and calls it a Heavenly Faculty. <hi>A purgative Medicine</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is not ſuch from its temperament, not as a Contrary acting upon its Contrary, not as a Simile attracting its Simile, nor as a heavy matter driving the humour downwards, nor as a light ſubſtance driving it upwards; but it hath this faculty alotted from above, acting by a Divine power.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This Celeſtial Faculty is alſo by ſome Medicks, <hi>(Fernel.)</hi> and Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers, <hi>(Scaliger)</hi> called an Occult Faculty; ſometimes alſo the property of the matter alone, ſometimes the internal principle of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing,
<note place="margin">The divers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominations of this quality.</note> ſometimes an unknown cauſe, a ſuper-elementary virtue, a property of the whole ſubſtance, and by ſome, a fifth quality; ſo that one and the ſame thing hath divers denominations.</p>
                        <p>But becauſe that this purgative virtue, according to Philoſophers of beſt note, muſt needs be deduced from the Stars, <hi>Meſue</hi> calls it moſt properly Celeſtial; but he aims amiſs in judging that it draws out humours, not as a ſimile attracting its ſimile, contrary to the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients opinions, reaſon, and experience. For <hi>Hippocrates</hi> declares, <hi>(lib. de nat human.)</hi> that purgative Medicaments have a certain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity with the humours: <hi>A Medicine</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>when it is aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med into the body, firſt attracts whatſoever is conſonant, and moſt like to its nature in the body, and afterwards draws down and purges away the reſt.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Which he proves clearly by this elegant compariſon; As ſeeds and plants ſown and eradicated in the ground, attract to themſelves whatever in the earth is congruent to their nature, whether ſharp or
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:37350:39"/>pleaſant, bitter or ſalt, or whatſoever elſe they primarily or chiefly allure, as having propinquity with their eſſence.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Galen</hi> demonſtrates this more clearly, illuſtrating it with many e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences, (<hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de nat. facult. &amp; cap.</hi> 23. <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>de ſimplic. &amp; lib. de Ther.</hi>) writing in expreſs words, that the operations are effected and perfected by the property of the qualities, which are in the ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: therefore ſome purgative Medicaments, if perchance they be fruſtrated of their acquired purgation, do not hurt the body (as ſome fooliſhly have imagined) but become nutrimental; others are turned into corruption and poyſon, yet a poyſonous virtue is not alwayes mixed with them. Wherefore they do not alwayes hurt, when they do not purge, but they concoct and produce ſuch humous as they ſhould have educed, which never happens to ſtronger Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                        <p>Therefore purgative Medicaments, by a certain ſimilitude and congruity to the ſubſtance, attract and educe humours, and by the ſame principle that the Loadſtone attracts Iron, and Amber Straw, not Iron the Loadſtone, or Straw Amber: for although there be a great ſimilitude betwixt the Loadſtone and the Iron, yet every ſimile is not the ſame, neither is the Loadſtone Iron, nor the Iron a Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone; yet the thing attracting ſhould be more potent than the thing attracted, and therefore the Iron, as weaker, is drawn, and draweth not.</p>

                           <hi>Since Traction comes by the ſimilitude of the ſubſtance, why doth not one Loadſtone attract another, and one piece of Iron another?</hi>

                           </label> I anſwer; One and the ſame thing doth not draw the ſame, but ſuch things as have an affinity and ſimilitude with them; ſo Agarick draws flegm, Rhabarb choler, Senna melancholy, becauſe there is betwixt them a certain conjugal quality, or rather a convenience or ſimilitude; which conformity is not altogether manifeſt; for Rha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barb differs much from choler, Agarick from flegm, and Senna from melancholy.</p>
                        <p>Although all Catharticks do attract humours,
<note place="margin">Quae purgant trahendo.</note> yet ſome of them do purge more eſpecially by attraction, to wit, ſuch as are of a more potent force, and have an excrementious humour, ſaith <hi>Meſue,</hi> as Scammony, Turbith, and Euphorbium; others by repreſſion,

For it is no wonder if the Medicine, by whoſe help, the corrupt part was cured, and from which it drew ſome malignity or other, being applyed to a ſound part, ſhould leave an impreſſion there of that malignity, whereof it parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipated.</p>
                        <p>But we intend to diſcourſe more particularly and largely of the ſpecificall, and admirable vertue of Quickſilver, in curing the Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian diſeaſe, and of the occult and almoſt divine vertues of other mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neralls.</p>

                        <head>CHAP. XI. <hi>Of ſimple Medicaments, which by a ſpecificall property have reſpect to certain peculiar parts.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p>MAny ſimples are adjoyned with ſuch a ſympathy to certaine Parts; that either aſſumed, or applyed, or often by their very ſmell, help, refreſh and free us from diſeaſes. Yet I cannot conceive, that they are for this ſympathy and correſpondency ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted to particular members, as thereon to ſpend all their effects, or not to confer any upon other parts, but that by a ſpeciall faculty they reſpect this more than that, and that more than another part.</p>
                        <p>So that many are called Cephalicks,
<note place="margin">Cephalica.</note> or head Medicaments that have their whole ſubſtance, congruent and familiar to the head; So fitted and prepared by the long experience and uſe of learned men, that with a certain kinde of ſympathy, they may be with ſafety appropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thereunto. As amongſt aromaticks theſe following, Muske, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, Civet, Cloves, Mace, Cinamon, Calamus aromaticus, Squirant, Camphure, and amongſt other more common ſimples, Betony,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:37350:41"/>Roſemary, Sage, Marjorum, Balm, <hi>Staechados,</hi> the Mirtle-tree, the flowers of Betony, Clove-gilliflowers, and Orange.</p>
                        <p>Ophthalmick, or Eye-medicaments, are theſe, and ſuch like,
<note place="margin">Ophthalmica.</note> Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bright, Salendine, Fennil, Rue, and Clary; the grains whereof put under the eye-lids, for they are ſo ſmall that they cauſe no ſenſe or trouble, purge eyes exceedingly from corrupt matter.</p>
                        <p>Thoſe are called Odonticks, which roborate the teeth,
<note place="margin">Odontica.</note> and cleanſe them, as the Maſtick-tree and Mirtle, Sage and Bay.</p>
                        <p>All dulcid things are agreeable and pleaſant to the Lungs; yet a certain herb, called Lung-wort, by a peculiar faculty is more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially attributed to the pains thereof.</p>
                        <p>If Foxes Lungs help, or any way profit Mens lungs,
<note place="margin">Pulmonica.</note> as many of the Antients believed, then it muſt happen through the familiarity of the ſubſtances; no other reaſon can be rendred.</p>
                        <p>Reyſons, Figs, Jujubees, Piſtac-nuts, Dates and Honey, do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what refreſh and benefit the Lungs, and that onely by their ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; Orrice, Maiden hair, Hyſlop, and Horehound, onely by atte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation.</p>
                        <p>Cardiacks or Cordials, are theſe and ſuch like; Gold, Silver,
<note place="margin">Cardiaca.</note> pretious Stones, Cinnamon, and other ſuavolent Aromaticks; and alſo Borage, Bugloſs, Carduus, Scabious, Goats-beard, Meadow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſweet, Violets, Roſes, and Saffron.</p>
                        <p>Stomachick, or Medicaments belonging to the Stomack,
<note place="margin">Stomachica,</note> are Nut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>megs, Maſtick, Wormwood, Mint, and Dill; for theſe by a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar property help it; and alſo innumerable more benefit it, but that by heat rather than any ſpecial virtue, as Pepper, Ginger, Muſtard, and Wine.</p>
                        <p>Hepaticks, or Medicaments proper to the Liver, are theſe; Tanſy,
<note place="margin">Hepatica.</note> Egrimony, Succory, Fumatory, Rhabarb.</p>
                        <p>Splenick, or Medicaments proper to the ſpleen, are Cetrack,

                        <p>I ſhall not hereunto reduce ſuch as reſpect ſeveral parts; for even a Critick Reader may be content with theſe; for a grain of Salt is ſufficient for him that would know its virtue, and learn its taſte.</p>

                        <head>CHAP. XII. <hi>Of Amulets, which carried or hanged up, do cure many Diſeaſes by an occult virtue.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p>THoſe Remedies that are called <hi>Periammata, Periapta,</hi> and <hi>Amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leta,</hi> that is, tryed and ſuſpended Medicaments, appertain to ſuch as cure Diſeaſes by an occult faculty:
<note place="margin">Amulets are of two ſorts.</note> and they are of two kinds; one ſort conſiſts ſolely of characters and words, another of ſimple Medicaments hanged about the neck, or any other member of the body. Phyſicians laugh at the former, and reject it as a thing fabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, deluſive, uncertain, and incredulous: for we finde, that neither Phyſician nor Metaphyſician ever ſpake thereof, unleſs ſome Caco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demoniack, that refers them to his Philoſophy. But a Phyſician and Philoſopher being a Moraliſt, and an Advancer of Nature, who in honeſty of life and converſation, ſetting the fear of the Almighty before his eyes, aſſayes nothing, but by the juſt, good and lawfull rule preſcribed by Nature, and doth not go about to deceive the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant and illiterate people with vain toyes, and unlawfull Arts; but ſtudies the knowledge of things by their natural cauſes: for Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is the underſtanding of a thing by its cauſe; and happy ſure is he that knows the cauſes of things. Whence <hi>Galen</hi> concludes, that Medicine is not made for the Diſeaſe, but for the morbificous cauſe, which being removed,
<note place="margin">Periammata.</note> the effect is hindred. But Amulets neither take away the cauſe, the diſeaſe, nor ſymptomes, as thoſe falſly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade themſelves, to whom they have been ſuſpended, being deceived by their perſwaſion, who worſhip and invoke Devils; who alſo ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, that all things may be done in their name, and by their virtue, without any other cauſe. Of which, and ſuch like impious fellows, the Poet thus writes:
<q>
                              <l>Gens inviſa diis maculandi calida coeli,</l>
                              <l>Quae nunc ſtare polos &amp; fulmina mittere novit,</l>
                              <l>Aethera ſub terras adigit, montéſque revellit.</l>
                           </q>
                        </p>
                        <p>Which they perform two manner of wayes: for ſome by the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of moſt Divine names invoke and compell evil ſpirits, and that becauſe every Creature fears and reverenceth his name that created: yet others more impious than theſe wicked men, ſubmit themſelves, offer ſacrifice, and worſhip Devils.</p>
                        <p>The reaſon why Witches uſe onely evil ſpirits, is manifeſt; for
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:37350:42"/>good Angels are very ſeldome,
<note place="margin">Cur cacodaemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes ab improbis viris invocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur.</note> and not without great difficulty ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, becauſe they wait on Gods command, and accompany none but ſuch as are of a clear heart, and pious converſation. But evil ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits do yield themſelves prompt and ready to be invoked, falſly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring and feigning Divinity, they are alwayes preſent, that they may deceive, and that they may be worſhipped and adored.</p>
                        <p>Out of this Shop of Devil-adoring Witches iſſued all thoſe Books of Darkneſs, which <hi>Ulpianus</hi> by no means will allow to be read,
<note place="margin">Libri improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tae lectiones qui.</note> but ordains that forthwith they be burned. The firſt Founder whereof was (as it is recorded) one <hi>Zabulus,</hi> that was addicted to the illicite Arts. Afterwards ſucceeded one <hi>Barnabas,</hi> a Cyprian; and in our times, <hi>Cornelius Agrippa,</hi> and many other impious men; amongſt which Crew, <hi>Paracelſus</hi> deſerves not to have the loweſt ſeat,
<note place="margin">Paracelſi im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pietas.</note> whoſe impiety was accompanied with the baſeneſs of all vices.</p>
                        <p>Now ſince that theſe Characters and Amulets have iſſued out of theſe impious mens Shops, being grounded on no reaſon,
<note place="margin">Characteres in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de prodterint.</note> and peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferous to Mankinde, not onely Phyſicians, but alſo all Worſhippers of God, ought to reject and abhor them.</p>
                        <p>Yet <hi>Fernelius,</hi> that excellent Phyſician and Philoſopher, yea, the moſt famous of our times, attributes great virtue to Words and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulets. And certainly if we aſſent to the Hebrews,
<note place="margin">Vis verborum ſecundum He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braeos.</note> the beſt Authors of Virtue and Diſcipline, they tell us, we ſhall finde greater power in words, than natural things; <hi>For</hi> (ſay they) <hi>whatſoever is in the minde, voice, word or ſpeech, all that is in Scripture, the letters whereof are full of beavenly myſteries, are according to the poſition of the Stars; whence the great Creator of all things will have himſelf named by two letters,</hi> Λ <hi>&amp;</hi> Ω.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, the more critical <hi>Matchiavels</hi> of the Hebrews,
<note place="margin">Literarum figura.</note> do profeſs and promiſe to explain all things by the figure of Letters, and by the ſimplicity, compoſition, crookedneſs, defect, abundance, col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation, revolution, coronation, apertion, order, and tranſmutation of letters, points, and pricks.</p>
                        <p>Words therefore and Characters are ſaid to be powerfull in the curing of Diſeaſes: and <hi>Trallian</hi> omitted not this way of curing. <hi>To cure the Gout</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>dig up the herb Henbane before the Sun riſe, when the Moon is in Aquarius, or Piſces, and ſay, Adjuro te, herba ſacra, per ſancta nomina Jaoth, Sabaoth, Adonai, Eloi, Deus, qui terram fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mavit, &amp; fixit mare fluviis abundans fluentibus, &amp; qui exſiccavit uxo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem Loth in ſtatuam ſalinariam. Adjuro, inquam, te, ut ſiſtas fluxio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem pedum.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>For the Tooth-ach this ridiculous ſpeech is given to ſome, <hi>Galbes, galbat, Galde, galda.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>To ſtay an iſſue of blood, ſome uſe theſe words, <hi>Charat, Cara, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, Confirma, Conſona, Imaholite.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Theſe words are given to ſome with a piece of bread, againſt the biting of a mad Dog, <hi>Irioni, Rhiciori, Eſtera, Rhuder, Fere;</hi> or theſe with a piece of an apple, <hi>Hax, Pax, Max, Deus, Adimax,</hi> which he preſently eats up.</p>
                        <pb n="22" facs="tcp:37350:43"/>
                        <p>That of <hi>Quint. Serenus</hi> of <hi>Samos,</hi> againſt the ſemi-tertian Feaver, is well known, to wit, <hi>Abracadabra,</hi> which is ſo deſcribed, that it ends broad below, and ſtrait above, like a Pine-apple, even to the laſt letter, and ſo it is annexed to the neck.</p>
                        <p>A thin plate of Gold engraven with theſe words, <gap reason="foreign">

                        </p>
                        <p>That thou mayſt ſtay bleeding, touch the part with thy ring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finger, and repeat theſe words, <hi>Socnon, Socnon,</hi> twenty ſeven times, or as oft as thou wilt, till the iſſue ceaſe; it is good; and much pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, if you rightly conſider it.</p>
                        <p>To cure the Felon, or ſoar under a mans nail, touch the part with thy finger, (ſaith <hi>Marcellus</hi>) and drawing thy finger back again, ſay thrice, <hi>Pu, pu, pu, Nunquam ego te videam per parietem repere.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>So doth the ſame <hi>Marcellus</hi> fooliſhly perſwade the cure of Lippi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, or Purblindneſs. <hi>Take</hi> (ſaith he) (<hi>cap.</hi> 8. <hi>lib. de medic.</hi>) <hi>a Fly with thy left hand, and whil'ſt thou catcheſt it, repeat his name on whom thou art to work this cure, and ſay that thou catcheſt the Fly to cure his eyes; then binde her alive in a linnen cloth, and hang it about the neck of him or her that is affected, and look not behind thee.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Many examples of the like ſort may be read in <hi>Mercury, Marcellus, Trallian, Albertus, Villanovanus,</hi> and amongſt thoſe in latter time, in <hi>Fernelius, lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de abdit. rerum cauſ.</hi> all which (moſt ſage men) at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute ſuch virtue to words, that they believe them to be able to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert nature. <hi>Apuleius</hi> alſo, that learned man, aſſerts, that by a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical ſuſurration, ſwift running rivers are turned back, the ſlow ſea gathered on a heap, the winds unanimouſly and with great force ſent forth, the ſun ſtaid, the ſtars deduced, the day abbreviated, the night continued: of which the Poet ſaith,

                        <p>But the power of words is moſt apparent in repelling Diſeaſes; for either ſpoken, or engraven and carried, do diſſolve many affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with wonderfull celerity, which, as <hi>Pomponatus</hi> relates, no little
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:37350:43"/>exerciſed a certain Phyſicians ingenuity and judgement, admiring ſuch things; for when he had undertaken the cure of two boyes,
<note place="margin">Hiſtoriae notatis dignae.</note> the one whereof laboured under a diſeaſe not unlike Eryſipely, the other had fallen into the fire; now a certain man intervening, cured thoſe boyes with words onely, and Charms. He adds moreover, that out of another who had a ſword ſo faſtned in him, that it could be got out by no medicinal Art, which notwithſtanding the ſame man drew out by the ſame method of curing.</p>
                        <p>In almoſt every Town there are certain old women who can cure the diſeaſes of the Matrix by words unknown to any; for ſo much they profeſs and promiſe, and ſometimes perform, not without great admiration.</p>
                        <p>I could relate a thouſand more examples, which becauſe they are ridiculous and fooliſh, I judge them better to be omitted; for in thoſe that are bettered by theſe words, either ſuſpended or rehearſed, the cure comes rather by a certain opinion, than any virtue in them.</p>
                        <p>One was not aſhamed to aſſert, that he was freed from a Feaver by an Amulet, in which theſe words were written, <hi>Sancti Petre &amp; Paule ſtultum hunc perſanate,</hi> that is, <hi>Saint Peter and Saint Paul cure this fool.</hi> Another was reſtored to health by this Amulet, <hi>Rapiat eum Dae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon &amp; ſimiles ejus,</hi> that is, <hi>The Devil take him and ſuch like.</hi> But I relate theſe ſore againſt my will: we will now turn our diſcourſe to others more approved. Thoſe Amulets which conſiſt of ſimple Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments, tyed or ſuſpended, are not altogether diſapproved of by Phyſicians; indeed they often produce ſalutary effects by an occult property. For Experience teacheth us, that the root of Peony hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about the neck, cures the Epilepſy; Miſletoe will do the ſame, as alſo a piece of an Elks hoof included in a ring. Wolfs dung ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed plaiſter-wiſe about the middle, will mitigate the cholerick pains, ſaith <hi>Aetius,</hi> (<hi>cap.</hi> 13. <hi>tet.</hi> 3. <hi>ſer.</hi> 4.) Their inteſtines dryed, and applyed to the belly, have like effects; the root of Hounds<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tongue hung about the neck, cures the blackneſs of the tongue, which the unskilfull Vulgars call Canker; for ſome things of ſmall quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity and bigneſs, by contract onely produce greateſt alterations, ſaith <hi>Galen,</hi> (<hi>cap.</hi> 5. <hi>lib.</hi> 6. <hi>de loco aff.</hi>) Dittany being applyed, doth by an incredible property draw out Darts; Quickſilver carried about with us, frees us from many peſtilent Diſeaſes; the ſtone <hi>Aethites</hi> bound betwixt the paps, or on the ventricle, doth retain the young; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing annexed to the thigh, precipitares the birth. Which alſo is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded of the root of Henbane. The gem <hi>Selenitis</hi> put into a ring, onely by touching the fleſh, ſtayes blood flowing from any part. The green Jaſper ſuſpended, helps the ſtomack, and the mouth of the ventricle, as <hi>Aetius</hi> teſtifies, (<hi>cap.</hi> 35. <hi>tet.</hi> 1. <hi>ſer.</hi> 2.) The Heraclean ſtone, commonly called the Loadſtone, beſides its faculty of attr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting Iron, being onely holden in the hand, it eaſeth the grief of the Gout both in the hands and feet. He that will carry the feet and the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:37350:44"/>fore-legs of the Lobſter, he ſhall not fear the coming of a Boar. See <hi>Democritus in Geopon.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The curing of the Jaundies is alſo to our purpoſe here;
<note place="margin">Icteri curatio miranda.</note> which is then effected, when the diſeaſed attentively beholds that Bird which <hi>Holerius</hi> calls <hi>Galbula,</hi> that is, Woodwall; the French give it the name of <hi>Loriotus.</hi> And it is wonderfull, that this Bird cannot endure the ſight of him that hath the Jaundies.</p>

                        </head>
                        <p>THere is alſo an occult quality in Poyſons, of which Phyſiologers, and ſearchers of natural things, do ſometimes ſpeak, as alſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious Witches: the Phyſiologers, that they might acknowledge the prudence and ſagacity of the Omnipotent Nature, in good as well as pernicious things, and contemplate the Ornament of the World: but thoſe Witches, more peſtilent than Peſtilence it ſelf, and moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious Enemies of Mankinde, that they might exanimate and extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate out of the world all thoſe whoſe life and fortunes they envy or hate. For they moſt artificially adulterate the taſte, odour, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of Poyſons, which they ſo craftily convey into Meats and Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caments, that they may deceive the moſt wiſe and wary, and in ſtead of Bread give them a Stone, in ſtead of a Fiſh a Scorpion, inſtead of Sugar a ſugared Poyſon. And ſo good men are not ſo ſafe from evil men, as all men from Scorpions, and other deſtructive Beaſts.</p>
                        <p>Of which the Phyſician ſpeaks, as the Logician of Sophiſms and Fallacies, which he admoniſhes us to obſerve and avoyd, as the Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loger ſpeaks of Vice, which he perſwades us to ſhun. Neither doth he treat of evil, that thence good might follow; wherein he differs from the Phyſician, who diſalloweth of poyſonfull Sorcerers, and yet treats of Poyſons, either as they are generated, or by ill luck in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted into our bodyes, or elſe as they are requiſite to the curing of malign diſeaſes; otherwiſe to diſcourſe of them, or uſe them, is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious. And indeed <hi>Galen,</hi> (<hi>cap.</hi> 42. <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de Antidot.</hi>) reproves them that teach compoſition of Poyſons,
<note place="margin">Improbantur, qui venena compenunt.</note> as <hi>Horummendeſius, Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, Heliodorus</hi> the Athenian, and <hi>Orpheus.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Yet doth he himſelf write largely concerning poyſonous Simples,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:37350:44"/>as before him <hi>Dioſcorides,</hi> and after both <hi>Nicander,</hi> that they might be known, avoyded, and by the advice of a learned and skilfull Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician, uſed in ſome diſeaſes. For Arſenick is ſometimes applyed to the dead fleſh in Ulcers, Vipers oil to Pocks-marks, pimples, and corrupt ſwellings; Scorpions oil to their ſtings; a hair of a mad Dog to the wound made by his own teeth. Trochisks made of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, both internally aſſumed, and externally applyed, to all poyſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous affections and diſeaſes.</p>
                        <p>Poyſons alſo are not onely put into,
<note place="margin">Venena in cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pore hominis interdum geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta.</note> but ſometimes generated in the body, as <hi>Galen,</hi> (<hi>cap.</hi> 5. <hi>lib.</hi> 6. <hi>loc. aff.</hi>) which produces both like affections and effects, as thoſe that come by pernicious poyſon drunk, or otherwiſe aſſumed; for a Plague is a Poyſon which is ſometimes generated in the body without any manifeſt cauſe; and the Sperm retained in Hiſterick women, is partaker of a poyſonous quality. Dogs alſo in the heat of Summer eaſily become mad. But theſe things are to be fore-known by Phyſicians, that they may preſerve health without fault, and drive away all diſeaſes.</p>
                        <p>And although Poyſons be deſtructive,
<note place="margin">Venena ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quando nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trire. Historia.</note> yet by cuſtome they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come nutritive; for I think the ſtory of the Girl is ſufficiently known, of which <hi>Avicenna, Rufus,</hi> and <hi>Gentilis</hi> ſpeak, who being fed with Poyſon onely from her Infancy, was ſo infectious, that her breath was peſtiferous and deſtructive to ſuch as came near her.</p>
                        <p>Another woman lived at <hi>Coleyn</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> who, as <hi>Albertus</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, did uſually eat Spiders, whereas one Spider bruiſed in Wine would kill many.</p>
                        <p>One <hi>Porus,</hi> King of <hi>India,</hi> did daily eat Snakes and Poyſons,
<note place="margin">Rex angui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus.</note> who being a long time nouriſhed with this kinde of Aliment, was ſo poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonfull, that he would kill men by his touch or breath, or by his ſpit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, as a Serpent, or any other poyſonous Creature.</p>
                        <p>There is a certain kinde of men in the Helleſpont,
<note place="margin">Ophiogenes.</note> who are nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed with Poyſons onely; and thence they are fitly called <hi>Ophio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes,</hi> that is to ſay, generated of Serpents.</p>
                        <p>The Marſians and Pſyllians delighted much in the ſame nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who feared not at all the bitings and poyſons of Serpents; which was experienced in one of that Family, <hi>Exagon</hi> by name, who by the Decree of the Roman Conſuls was put into a Hogſhead filled with Serpents, who nevertheleſs eſcaped without detriment. (<hi>Plin. cap.</hi> 29. <hi>lib.</hi> 6.)</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Athenageras</hi> the Grecian, as it is related, could not be hurt by Scorpions. The ſame is affirmed of the Ethiopians that inhabit near the River <hi>Hydaſpes.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Galen</hi> makes mention (<hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>ſimp. cap.</hi> 13.) of a certain Athenian woman, which had often eat a great quantity of Hemlock, without any prejudice to her health. <hi>Sext. Emperic.</hi> hath the ſame ſtory of another old woman.</p>
                        <p>'Tis generally reported of <hi>Lyſis,</hi> that ſhe would eat Opium in a
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:37350:45"/>great quantity, without impairing her health; and I ſaw a woman of <hi>Nemaxium,</hi> who daily took half a dram of the ſame.</p>
                        <p>A certain maid of <hi>Crete</hi> did kill ſeveral with her looks, and bring boyes into a conſumption. What need of more? they that are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to Poyſons, are free from the miſchief of them.</p>
                        <p>Poyſons are drawn either from Plants,
<note place="margin">Whence Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon proceeds.</note> Animals, or Minerals. From Plants, as from all kinds of Poppy, from Henbane and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drakes; whoſe qualities, though they be poyſonous, yet often times effectual for curing many Diſeaſes. And thoſe very things which ſometimes are preſent poyſon both to man and beaſt, yet being rightly handled, prepared, and applyed; they are a ſecure help.</p>
                        <p>The herb Wolfs bane is poyſon,
<note place="margin">Poyſons ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times are me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camental.</note> yet it is added to Ophthalmick Medicaments; and Hemlock, though poyſonous, yet effectual in extinguiſhing Tetters, Ulcers, and Leprous ſpots.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Nerium</hi> alſo drunk in Wine, is good againſt the bitings of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents. Houſe-leek killeth the Ringworm, and ſpreading ſoars. All kinds of Night-ſhade, rightly applyed, doth mitigate any pain.</p>
                        <p>But all theſe, according to <hi>Dioſcorides,</hi> are poyſonous; as alſo <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunculus, Eſula, Hermodactylus;</hi> yet the uſe thereof is not onely wholſome, but effectual in many diſtempers. As alſo <hi>Aconitus, Herba Paris,</hi> yea Antimony and <hi>Stibium,</hi> and many others, are both medicamental and poyſonous, for they both cure and kill.</p>
                        <p>Muſhtooms alſo are not altogether Medicaments, but ſometimes Aliment, and ſometimes Poyſon; for by the uſe of theſe, five young Students of <hi>Paris</hi> were killed; and yet Courtiers are much taken with ſuch Diſhes.</p>
                        <p>I ſhall not here renumerate other poyſonous Plants, which are daily and fortunately put to medicinal uſes, for it may ſuffice that I have touched upon a few, becauſe it is not neceſſary, neither can they all be comprehended in one Chapter.</p>
                        <p>Medicaments alſo are taken from poyſonfull Animals;
<note place="margin">Medicines daily aſſumed from poyſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Animals.</note> for the fleſh of <hi>Stinci marini</hi> is often given to decayed Nature to excite Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nery.</p>
                        <p>Vipers do admirably benefit ſuch as are leprous; as alſo Snakes, whoſe fleſh rightly prepared, is a ſure Antidote againſt many Poyſons.</p>
                        <p>That which is aſſerted <hi>de Dracone marino,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Sea-dragon is both Poyſon and Aliment.</note> exceeds credit; for he hath a ſharp pointed bone upon his back, ſo noxious to man, that whomſoever he pricks, is precipitated to death, unleſs he be helped in time; yet his fleſh is both pleaſant and wholſome nutriment, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that the common ſort of Frenchmen call it Fleſh of Life. And ſo it may ſeem wonderfull, that ſome Animals do at once ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt Aliment, Nutriment, and Poyſon; for ſome part of them is life, in others death to the Aſſumers.</p>
                        <p>Yet 'tis very ſtrange that poyſonfull Animals, whoſe bodies are enemies to ours, and preſent death, ſhould by application ſafely cure the wounds and bitings that they themſelves have made; and they
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:37350:45"/>alone, in many caſes, are able to free us from ſuch wounds, and the perils enſuing. The reaſon is, becauſe one ſimile attracts another to it; and as it were revoking its own ſubſtance, frees the part affected from Poyſon. So Crocodiles greaſe cures thoſe that are ſmitten by him; and thoſe that are hurt with Scorpions, are cured by the ſame, bruiſed and applied plaiſterwiſe; <hi>Mus Araneus</hi> will work the ſame effect, if pulveriſed when it hath bitten any.</p>
                        <p>It is alſo worthy our notice taking, that Poyſon doth not onely at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract Poyſon, but alſo extract pricks and darts out of our bodies without pain, which can ſcarce be by any ſtrength or art effected.</p>
                        <p>Many ſmall Creatures are altogether noxious to humane bodies, and yet uſefull and commodious to health; as Cantharides, the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemous Fly <hi>Bupreſtis,</hi> Salamanders, Palmer worms, a Sea-hare, a Toad, a Fen frog; for we uſe Cantharides, Lizards, Scorpions, and Ants daily and effectually to the outward parts, but not to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; for it is altogether unſafe to put thoſe Creatures into the body which are naturally endowed with an evil quality. Thus did one <hi>Agyrta,</hi> a forreign and unskilfull Phyſician,
<note place="margin">Idem fecit ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledictus ille He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braeus Franco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>furtanus, Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron vocatus, qui ante bien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium ad Caco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daemones ſuos abiit.</note> apply Cantharides to a man well known to be honeſt, but not wiſe, who deſired a Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to provoke him to Venery; which ſent him not to the pleaſant Fields of <hi>Venus,</hi> but to the Boat of <hi>Charon.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Yet there are ſome, although noxious, which hurt either by biting or touching; which being prepared by expert Artificers, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by skilfull Phyſicians, and opportunely applyed, do not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly no hurt, but produce admirable and ſalutary effects; for Wine, wherein by miſchance a Viper had been ſuffocated and extinguiſhed, cured a Leper, long before ſeparated from the ſociety of his Fellow-Citizens. A Snake may perform and effect the ſame. What then will their fleſh do, skilfully prepared?</p>
                        <p>Many efficacious Poyſons alſo are drawn from Minerals,
<note place="margin">Ex mineralibus venena multa.</note> and theſe as well growing of their own accord, as Quick-ſilver, red Lead, Parget, Vitriol, Sory, Sandarach, the Loadſtone, crude Antimony, alſo the Adamant: as thoſe that are made ſuch by Art, as Sublimate Chalk; Verdegreaſe, Ceruſe, <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> and almoſt innumerable others, which are much better unknown, than known; for it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to treat of ſome Simples beneficial to ſome Diſeaſes, amongſt which ſome are to be preferred before others, as leſs averſe to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and more conducing to health.</p>

                        <head>CHAP. XIV. <hi>Of the faculties of thoſe Medicaments in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, which are named from their effects.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p>WE have before ſhewed, that ſome Medicaments reſpect and corroborate ſome parts by a ſpecifical virtue, as Cephalick reſpect the head, Ophthalmick the eyes, Pulmoniack, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patick, the Lungs, Liver, Spleen, and others, other parts, from whence they had their denomination: Now we ſhall ſpeak briefly and generally of ſuch as are named from their effects, that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecary may have in readineſs the name and knowledge of Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, with their reſpective quality, to the propoſed and deſired ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects. For ſince names are the marks of things, if they be conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently and rightly fitted to them, they will more aptly teach, guide, and direct the Artificer.</p>
                        <p>But almoſt all Medicaments retain their Greek idioms firſt impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed on them.
<note place="margin">Medicamento<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum appellatio a quibus.</note> Some named from the Arabian Language, have ſcarce re-obtained their firſt and proper euphony; yet have they in proceſs of time been ſomewhat refined. Medicaments therefore from their effects are thus named by Claſſical Authors.</p>
                        <p>A Medicament is called <hi>Cathartick,</hi> or purging, becauſe by ſome way it draws noxious humours out of our bodies, as by vomiting, or ſeceſſion.</p>
                        <p>Phyſicians call that <hi>Cholagogon,</hi> or a choler-purging Medicament, which extracts cholerick humours; that which purges flegm, <hi>Phleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magogon;</hi> that which purgeth melancholy, <hi>Melanagogum;</hi> that which purgeth watry or liquid humours, <hi>Hydragogum;</hi> and that which purgeth all humours, <hi>Panchymagogon.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Another Medicament is called <hi>Polychreſtum,</hi> becauſe it is of much uſe.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Eccoproticon</hi> is reckoned amongſt the benign Medicaments, and is ſo called, becauſe it onely moves the dregs.</p>
                        <p>Thoſe are called <hi>Hypercatharctica,</hi> or too much purging Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which firſt purge that humour to which it is congruent and familiar, afterwards other humours more apt to follow; laſt of all, blood; ſo that they cauſe the Bloody Flux.</p>
                        <p>They are called <hi>Emetica,</hi> that provoke vomiting, and educe the humours by the mouth.</p>
                        <p>They are called <hi>Alliotica,</hi> that is, altering, which alter any diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, as hot alters cold, cold hot, moyſt dry, <hi>Euchyma</hi> and <hi>Cacochyma,</hi>

<note place="margin">Secundae quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates quot dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferentiis inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duntur.</note> which eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially differ in four kinds, for ſome are tangible, others odorable, others guſtable, and others viſible; audible qualities are omitted, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe no certain election can be made by them. Now thoſe are ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible qualities which can be diſcerned by the judgment of the touch, ſome whereof are the properties of the Elements, to wit, in which the firſt qualities hot, cold, moiſt and dry, are diſcerned by the touch; others ariſe from the temperament, and are called ſecond qualities; by whoſe means the Medicament is heavy or light, hard or
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:37350:49"/>ſoft, clammy, or friable, ſharp or ſmooth as above.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly,
<note place="margin">Odor quid.</note> Medicaments may be ſelected from their odour, which is a certain vaporous ſubſtance proceeding from an odorable matter, which brought into the noſtrills, moves the ſence of ſmelling, and there are as many kinds of them, as ſapors: for odors concord with ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours in proportion, and for the moſt part borrow their demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from them, yet are not the ſpecies of odours ſo diſtinct as them of ſapours, becauſe the ſenſe of ſmelling in men is very dull; hence it is that there are a thouſand kinds of odours that want proper names, and therfore all odorables are generally diſtinguiſhed into well ſmel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and ill ſmelling things.</p>
                        <p>Fiftly, the judgement in Election may be guided by the Taſte of Medicaments,
<note place="margin">Sapor quid. Sapores quet.</note> and that more ſurely than by Odours; becauſe there are more diſtinct ſpecies of ſapors than of Odours (<hi>lib.</hi> 4. <hi>ſimpl. Med. Gal. cap.</hi> 21.) for ſapour is a quality that may be perceived by the ſenſe of Taſting, whereof there be nine different ſpecies, three whereof flow from over-powering calidity in a ſubſtance, groſſe or ſubtill, to wit, ſharpe, bitter, ſalt, three from exuperant frigidity, ſowre, auſtere, unpleaſant, and three from moderate heat, pleaſant, fat, unſavory,
<note place="margin">Selectio medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camentorum à diſpoſitione ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſeca.</note> the laſt whereof inclines to frigidity, pleaſant &amp; fat to heat.</p>
                        <p>Sixtly, Medicaments may be ſelected by a diſpoſition extrinſecal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acquired, which ariſes from the ſeaſon or place (<hi>Gal. cap.</hi> 2. <hi>lib.</hi> 4.) <hi>Meſue,</hi> addes Magnitude, Parvitude, and Number, for by theſe the quality of the Medicament is of more or leſſe force. A certain and univerſall rule cannot be given concerning the temper and choiſe of Medicaments by their colour and ſound, that thereby the benigne may be diſcerned from the malignant: for ſeeing all benignity and malignity of Medicaments conſiſts in the ſubſtance, temperament and faculties, cold, moiſt, hot, and dry, are found in all colours. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do the colours themſelves ſhew the temperament of the Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, for the colour of a medicament may very eaſily be changed by ſome externall accident.</p>
                        <p>The judgement alſo of the benignity &amp; malignity of a medicament from its ſound is as uncertain as from its colour: for there is no uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall, but onely a particular and accidentall knowledge thereof, as in <hi>Caſſia, Carthamus,</hi> and ſome few more.</p>

                        <p>EVery Cathartick attracts the humour moſt like it ſelf, but <hi>Meſne</hi> aſſerts that ſome purge more particularly by attraction, as all thoſe that are more valid, ſome by repreſſion as Styp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, ſome by lenitude, as viſcid and lubricating Medicaments, and
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:37350:49"/>ſome by mollifying, as moſt Malacticks. But of thoſe that purge by Traction, thoſe are to be judged better that are lighter, and the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier malignant; for the levity of a ſubſtance ſhews its ſubtilneſs and rarity, gravity its craſſitude and denſity.
<note place="margin">Eorum, quae trahendo pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant, quaenam meliora.</note> Now thoſe that conſiſt of groſs matter, do hurt more; as alſo thoſe that have ſuperfluous hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midity; by how much they are lighter, by ſo much better, unleſs they be decayed; for thoſe that are lighter have leſs ſuperfluous hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midity, which ſubverts the ventricle, and cauſes pain.</p>
                        <p>The ſtate of thoſe that purge by repreſſion from a Styptick facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty conſiſting in the terreſtrial matter,
<note place="margin">Quae compri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendo purgant quomodo ſeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genda.</note> which through their native con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition and temper are ſolid, not rare, is contrary to the former; which are to be judged of from their plenitude or vacuity, becauſe theſe naturally ſhould be groſs, not rare; for by how much theſe are hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier, by ſo much better. As alſo thoſe that purge by leniating, lubri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating, and mollifying, becauſe the faculty of mollifying and lubri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating proceeds from humidity, which neceſſarily ſuppoſes gravity. But that humidity is natural, and of its proper temper, not excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentious, which makes the Medicaments better.</p>
                        <p>We may judge of rare and denſe ſubſtances, as of light and heavy, for levity concomitates rarity, as denſity doth gravity, for the tearms are reciprocal: but thin and friable are not the ſame, for every friable thing is not thin, nor every pliant groſs, nor on the contrary: but if any Medicament be thin and pure, it muſt neceſſarily be friable and tender; and if any Medicament be groſs and impure, it will be viſcid and clammy; theſe excepted in pliant humid ſubſtances, as Honey, Manna, Butter, Oil; that which is purer is better, and what impurer worſe. That is properly called groſs, which cannot eaſily be made ſmooth, or which cannot be bruiſed into thin parts; and that thin; which can eaſily be ſo reduced. That is called thick or denſe,
<note place="margin">Craſſum, Tenue. Denſum. Rarum. Grave. Lentum. Friabile.</note> that can paſs through none or few Orifices. That rare, which is apt to paſs through many. That is heavy, which being compact, is more conſpicuous by weight than magnitude. That light, which is leſs in weight than bigneſst That which is pliant is ſo much oppoſite to that which is friable, that the pliant can ſcarce be wrought upon by pulling or bruiſing; whereas the friable is bruiſed to powder, even with a touch or weight of a finger.</p>
                        <p>Now for matter of Temperaments; in ſimple Temperatures hot Medicaments are better than cold, and moyſt than dry; in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds, hot and moyſt are moſt wholſome, cold and dry moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous. But if the election be made from degrees of intention, whereas mans temperament is moderate, by how much the Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment comes nearer mans temper, by ſo much it is more wholſome; and by how much it is more remote, by ſo much more malignant. So that what Medicament ſoever is four degrees diſtant from the mean, that Medicament is worſt; and thoſe Medicaments that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the extream of four degrees, are rather to be adjudged Poyſons than Medicaments.</p>
                        <pb n="36" facs="tcp:37350:50"/>
                        <p>Now we may thus judge of Medicaments,
<note place="margin">De delectu in ſecundis quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatibus.</note> by reaſon of their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond qualities, as of Tangibles; when one Medicament of the ſame kinde is hard, another cold; one ſharp, and another ſmooth; in theſe the foft is to be preferred before the hard, and the ſmooth before the ſharp or rough.
<note place="margin">Durum quid</note> We call that hard, according to <hi>Galen, (cap ult. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>de differ. pulſ.</hi>) which is harder than our fleſh, or to which our fleſh yields;

                        <p>Now election of Medicaments may be made from Odour,
<note place="margin">Delectus ab odore.</note> for this cauſe, becauſe a ſweet oppleaſant ſmell refreſhes the ſpirits, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtores ſtrength and vigour to them, exhilarates the principal mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers and parts, and corroborates their faculties. An ill and ſtinking ſmell on the contrary burthens and aggravates the head, vexes the heart, ſubverts the ventricle, infects the ſpirits, moves a loathing, cauſes grievous and laborious purgings, and oftentimes vomitings.

                        <p>WE have with Phyſicians of beſt note aſſerted, (<hi>Oribaſ cap.</hi> 5. <hi>lib.</hi> 14. <hi>collect.</hi>) that three of the nine ſapours are hot, three cold,
<note place="margin">Sapor acer qualis.</note> and three temperate. Of all which, the ſharp, tart ſapour is hotteſt, which being incited by our heat, whereby it is reduced from a potency to an act, bites, corrodes, expreſſes the ſenſe of a fiery qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and in a manner burns, as Indian Pepper, as Pelitory, or as a little flame.</p>
                        <p>There are of theſe ſharp ſapours many kinds,
<note place="margin">Aerium multa genera.</note> (<hi>Gal. cap.</hi> 17. <hi>lib.</hi> 4. <hi>ſimpl.</hi>) for ſome are hot and dry, exceeding the fourth degree of heat, and are poyſon, as Sublimate, and Arſenicks. Others have much humidity mixed with a fiery heat, whereby they are made ſomewhat pleaſant, and edible, as Garlick, Onions, Leeks, Garden creſſes, and
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:37350:50"/>ſuch like. Others are contained in a third order, as the herb Galin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal, Pepper, Savine, Treacle muſtard, Snap-dragon, Helicampane. Others are more moderate, as Thyme, Hyſſop, Aniſe, Coriander, Radiſh-root, Origane. And others are ſharp abſolutely and ſimply, and ſome are mixed with other ſapours, as ſuch Medicaments as are ſharp and bitter.</p>
                        <p>Next to the ſharp ſapour is the bitter,
<note place="margin">Amarus ſapor.</note> which proceeds from the aſſation of the ſubtil terreſtrial parts; and it hath not the power of corroding as the ſharp, but more cleanſing than the ſaltiſh; ſo that it trouble ſomely exaſperates the tongue, (<hi>Paul. Aegin. cap.</hi> 1. <hi>lib.</hi> 7. <hi>Galen. cap.</hi> 10. <hi>lib.</hi> 4. <hi>ſimplic.</hi>) and it is two-fold; the one hot, ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of before, which ariſes from the aſſation of terreſtrial parts, by which ſweet things are made bitter, either by concoction, or by age; the other cold, which comes by vehement congelation, as in Opium, wild Succory, Lettices, Hemlock, and ſome unripe Fruits; or which comes from an inchoated or imperfect coction, or rather from remiſs heat which is accounted cold, as the other from an intenſe heat; for there is ſcarce any compound which is not endued with divers natures and qualities; whence it is no wonder, if Opium and Hemlock be partly hot, and partly cold. One ſcruple of <hi>Coloquintis</hi> may induce to two pounds weight of water bitterneſs, but no heat, unleſs it be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſmall and occult. Yet <hi>Schegkius</hi> thinks that ſome are hot, becauſe of their bitterneſs, and that they refrigerate by an occult virtue, as Poppies and Succory, <hi>(lib. de occult. medic. facult.)</hi> Now a bitter ſapour is ſuch, either ſimply, as in Aloes; or mixed with other ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours, as in Wormwood, to which a ſtypticity or aſtriction is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed. As alſo we may experience in many unripe Fruits, which not having as yet attained their perfect magnitude, are bitter ſour; but being mature, they are bitter, and withall ſweet, with a kinde of ſourneſs.</p>
                        <p>Next to bitter and ſalt ſapour,
<note place="margin">Salſus.</note> which is not ſo dry becauſe of its watry humidity, wherewith its terrene ſubſtance is tempered. (<hi>Orib. &amp; Gal. cap.</hi> 20. <hi>lib.</hi> 4. <hi>ſimplic.</hi> Furthermore, it cleanſeth moderate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, yea, it waſheth the tongue more moderately than bitter ſapours, and it is pleaſant enough to the taſters, endued with ſome aſtrictive faculty; yet not ſo much as to contract the tongue, as the auſtere or acerb ſapour.</p>
                        <p>Now this ſalt ſapour is two-fold; the one natural, the other arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial; Natural, as in Salt, Sea-water, and many ſalt terrene ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances; Artificial, as in Lee, Lime, and in Chymick Salts.</p>
                        <p>All ſour ſapour is cold of it ſelf, or ſo naturally; as in thoſe things,
<note place="margin">Aridus.</note> whoſe cold temper is conjoyned with tenuity of ſubſtance, as the juice of Limmons, Oranges, Sorrel, and ſuch like; or ſo by acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, as by putrefaction, (<hi>Act. cap.</hi> 1. <hi>tetr.</hi> 1. <hi>ſerm.</hi>) by which means Wine is ſaid to be ſour, yet not ſo abſolutely, for it hath ſome Acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony in it ſelf, as <hi>Galen</hi> atteſteth, (<hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>ſimplic.</hi>)</p>
                        <p>Hence ariſes another diviſion of ſour ſapour, to wit, into that
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:37350:51"/>which is exactly ſuch, as the ſapours before mentioned, and into that which is not exactly ſuch, but is conjoyned with ſome other ſapour, whether ſweet, bitter, or ſharp, as four-ſweet Fruits, as Apples, Prunes, Mulberries, Cherries. Some Fruits have alſo bitterneſs joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with their ſourneſs, as Perſian Apples, and ſome Cherries. Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar partakes of Acrimony, and a mixed quality, as <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith, (<hi>c.</hi> 19. 21. <hi>&amp;</hi> 26. <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>ſimplic.</hi>) becauſe of its acquired heat; yet its fourneſs exceeds its Acrimony, as Acrimony exceeds ſourneſs, in Oils of Sulphur and Vitriol, educed by Chymical Art, which cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rode and bite the tongue; and taken alone, do greatly calefy. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore, ſour ſapour, as to its impreſſion upon the tongue, it cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodes, bites, penetrates, and exterges, and all without calefaction, unleſs it have ſome other quality mixed with it, as <hi>Galen</hi> aſſerts, (<hi>cap.</hi> 2. <hi>lib.</hi> 4. <hi>ſimpl.</hi>) in which it differs from ſharp ſapour, although ſour ſapours ferment the earth for the tenuity of their parts with heat pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by putrefaction.</p>
                        <p>The auſtere or ſtyptick ſapour doth moderately ſtrain and exaſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the tongue and mouth,
<note place="margin">Austerus.</note> and in ſome meaſure dry and refrigerate; and it is very peculiar to many immature Fruits, as to Quinces, to the fruit of the Dog-tree, and many Pears, eſpecially wild Pears. The matter conſiſts in a mean, to wit, partaker both of a terreſtrial and watry nature, in which frigidity is predominant. Wherefore all au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtere ſapours are frigid, moderately aſtringing and repelling fluxes; and it differs from an acerb ſapour, in that it is more humid, and aſtringeth and exaſperates leſs. For <hi>Galen,</hi> (<hi>cap.</hi> 7. <hi>lib.</hi> 4. <hi>ſimplic.</hi>) ſaith, that watry humidity doth much retund and dullify the ſtrength of every ſapour.</p>
                        <p>But when natural heat begins to domineer in the very matter, and the watry matter mixed with the terrene hath attained to maturity, then the auſterity evinced and expelled, dulcity ſucceeds in the ſame matter; and ſo auſtere Fruits after mutation become ſweet, which mutation is not of the matter, but quality.</p>
                        <p>Acerb ſapour,
<note place="margin">Acerbus.</note> ſometimes called Pontick and Styptick, differs from the auſtere ſapour onely by reaſon of more or leſs, (<hi>Aet. cap.</hi> 1. <hi>tetr.</hi> 1. <hi>fer.</hi> 1.) for thereby it more grievouſly and ſtrongly aſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and exaſperates the tongue and mouth, (<hi>Aet. cap.</hi> 4. <hi>lib.</hi> 2.) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it conſiſts more of dry and terrene matter, not apertly parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of watry humidity. And in it cold with ſiccity is more predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant than heat; for every acerb ſapour is cold. Now this ſapour is moſt conſpicuous in Gall nuts, in unripe Medlars, and ſorb Apples.</p>
                        <p>Sweet ſapour is mild and pleaſant to the taſt,
<note place="margin">Dulcis.</note> and familiar and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to the belly and ſtomack, ſaith <hi>Galen,</hi> (<hi>c.</hi> 14. <hi>lib.</hi> 4. <hi>ſimpl. com. ad aphor.</hi> 37. <hi>lib.</hi> 5.) becauſe it hath a mild calidity, and lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable temper: wherefore ſweet things onely nouriſh, and the Infant in the womb onely draws the ſweeteſt blood. Now ſweet differs from oily, becauſe an oily ſapour is leſs pleaſant, whereas otherwiſe their temperaments are one, and their impreſſions on the tongue
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:37350:51"/>alike: for that which is ſweet, lenifies and dilates the little fibres of the tongue, takes away aſperity, and cleanſes away whatever inheres to the tongue. Now this ſweet ſapour is moſt apert in Sugar, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, Manna, Liccoriſh, Milk, Reyſons, Jujubs, and mature Fruits. <hi>Theophraſtus</hi> conſtitutes four ſpecies of this ſapour, to wit, milky, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, watry, and winy.</p>
                        <p>The unctious or oily ſapour is ſweet, and nouriſheth, as <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith, (<hi>cap.</hi> 9. <hi>lib.</hi> 4. <hi>ſimpl.</hi>) that whatſoever nouriſheth is ſweet, or of a kinde of ſweet ſapour: yet they are diſtinct; for watry humidity is of ſweet things, aery of fat things; whence it eaſily melts in the fire, and is rather ſauce than nutriment, (<hi>cap.</hi> 10. <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>de Aliment.</hi>) for it lenifies and fills the exaſperate parts of the tongue, as Butter, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, Oil. Now unctious ſapour is ſuch, either exquiſitely, as all oily and fat things; or moderately, as the root of Mallows and Lillies.</p>
                        <p>The inſipid or unſavoury ſapour is next to ſwell,
<note place="margin">Inſipidus.</note> and it deflects more to frigidity, by reaſon of its watry ſubſtance not well elabora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by its inbred heat; and it is evident in things not perfectly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocted and cold; for all unſavoury Aliments are pituitous, (<hi>Gal. cap.</hi> 46. <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de facult. aliment.</hi>) but is more properly obſervable in Water, Citrul, Gourds, and ſuch like; for it affects the tongue with no manifeſt quality, neither is it properly a ſapour, but rather a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of ſapour, as the name ſhews. The Latins call it <hi>fatuum,</hi> that is, fooliſh or unſavoury, becauſe it moves the ſenſe with no manifeſt quality, it leaves an impreſſion much like to that of Hydraeolean.</p>

                        </head>
                        <p>THat diſpoſition of a Medicament which is extrinſecally ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, and which gives better knowledge to their ſelecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, proceeds either from the time wherein they are to be gathered, or from the place where they are depoſited. As to the time, three things are worthy to be known; firſt, when they ought to be gathered; ſecondly, to what time their virtue remains perfect; thirdly, in what time they are better and more uſefull; for ſome are better new than old, others better old than new, others beſt in the middle of the time.</p>
                        <p>As to the firſt,
<note place="margin">Quo tempore colligenda me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicamenta.</note> we affirm that Medicaments are then to be gathered, when their virtue is better and more uſefull. But nevertheleſs all parts of Plants are not equally, and at one time and ſeaſon, effectual and wholſome: For Roots ſhould be gathered at one time, Stalks at another, Leaves at another, Flowers and Fruits, Seeds, Juices and Gums, at another time.</p>
                        <p>And ſo Roots ſhould be gathered in ſeveral ſeaſons of the year,
<note place="margin">Quovis tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve quaedam ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices colligenda</note> not in Autumn only, as is aſſerted by <hi>Dioſcorides, Avicenna,</hi> and many
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:37350:52"/>others. Nor alſo in the Spring alone, as <hi>Saladinus</hi> would have them: but ſome may be effoded and gathered at any time, to wit, ſuch as are alwayes vegetive and juicy, although the ſtalks be dry, as the roots of Bugloſs, Sorrel, Licoriſh, Saint <hi>Chriſtophers</hi> herb, Smallage, Butchers broom, Cyperus, Sow bread, Lillies, Mallows, and many more. Others as ſoon as their leaves are fallen, at which time the virtue of the Plant goes into the root, and then the humour is more throughly cocted than at other times, as <hi>Enula campana, Angelicae,</hi> Peony, Briony, Bugloſs. Others are to be pulled up and gathered ere the virtue of the Plant be diffuſed into branches, leaves, flowers, and ſeed, as Polypody, Flower-de-luce, Saint <hi>Maries</hi> ſeal, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, Ragwort. And ſome are beſt to be gathered in Spring and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn, as the roots of Mallows and Lillies, Eringes, Galangal, Sour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dock, Radiſh, &amp; many more which have ſtore of natural Juice in them.</p>
                        <p>But the ſtocks and ſtalks are to be gathered when they are perfect; leaves and flowers before they fall of themſelves, for then for the moſt part they are perfect. Fruits, when they are ripe; the juices of herbs and leaves while young branches are ſprouting out.</p>
                        <p>Gums are to be drawn and preſſed out of the ſtalks gaſhed while it is freſh, in the beginning of the Spring, or beginning of Summer, while the juice aſcends into the ſtalk. And all Medicaments, by <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcorides</hi> advice, are to be gathered when the Heavens are clear.</p>
                        <p>Now how long the virtue of purging, altering,
<note place="margin">De duratione virtutis medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camentorum.</note> or roborating Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments endure, cannot definitely be ſhewed and determined upon. For ſince that every thing hath its proper age, and a peculiar antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or recency conſiſts in ſeveral Medicaments, the time of duration is not the ſame in all, for Rhabarb will keep freſh, potent and valid three years, others decay ſooner, as of roots ſuch as have thin ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, as the root of Valerian, <hi>Aſarum,</hi> Ragwort, which are effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and valid onely one year.</p>
                        <p>Some endure five or ſix years, as Ariſtolochy; Butchers-broom, Cypetus; others ten years, as the greater Centaury; and according to <hi>Threophraſtus,</hi> others thirty years, as Hellebore; others forty years, as black Chameleon; and ſome a hundred, as <hi>Elaterium:</hi> and if the ſame Author ſpeaks true, <hi>Elaterium</hi> hath been found of two hundred years old, which was very good and pretious. Therefore we can ſcarce determine in general for what ſeaſon or time the virtue of a Medicament, eſpecially purging, is efficacious, but onely ſpecially of ſome, and ſeveral; ſeeing we ſhall diſcourſe in our <hi>Officina Pharma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copolarum</hi> particularly of theſe, wherein we ſhall moſt largely declare and treat of the compoſition of Medicaments.</p>
                        <p>Yet may this rule be laid down as general, if not altogether,
<note place="margin">Quando vis medicamento<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum praestan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tior.</note> yet for the moſt part true: That all Medicaments conſiſting of a thin and rare ſubſtance, and all ſuch as abound in much humidity, continue but a ſhort time efficacious: but thoſe that are groſs and ſolid, and leſs humid, endure longer, becauſe their virtue cannot ſo eaſily exolve and periſh.</p>
                        <pb n="42" facs="tcp:37350:53"/>
                        <p>The third thing remains yet unapplyed, to wit, at what time the virtue of purging Medicaments is better and more valid, ſeeing ſome are better new than old, others on the contrary, and others in their middle age.
<note place="margin">Quando recen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia meliora.</note> Now that this dignotion may be certain, and that the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection may be good, it ought to be taken from certain differences of ſapours, and from the variety of the ſubſtance, whereby we judge ſome new to be better than old Medicaments, as ſtyptick and bitter, which being ill from their imbred ſiccity, become worſe by age, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſiccity increaſes in theſe by time; but being new, they have hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midity, which tempers the exceſs of heat and ſiccity.</p>
                        <p>Thoſe alſo that have but weak virtue, as the flowers of Violets, Borrage, purple colour'd Lilly, Bugloſs, Roſemary; or thoſe whoſe virtue is poſited in the ſuperficies, and therefore eaſily reſoluble, becauſe of the rarity of the ſubſtance, are better new than old, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all Flowers, eſpecially thoſe whoſe odour quickly fails.</p>
                        <p>On the contrary,
<note place="margin">Quando vetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſta meliora.</note> ſome old ones are better than new, eſpecially ſharp Medicaments, which are of thin parts, becauſe the fiery heat poſited in the ſuperficies, which cauſes their biting and burning, by age expires. And what Acrimony remains within, in time waxes mild, and is broken, as <hi>Galen</hi> ſpeaks of <hi>Eupherbium, cap.</hi> 2. <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>de comp. med. gen.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In Onions and Garlick the caſe is otherwiſe, for their Acrimony proceeds from heat conjoyned with humidity, which taken away, they are more ſharp, and therefore better new.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, thoſe whoſe virtue is valid from the temperament, and hardly reſoluble for the denſity of their ſubſtance not poſited in the ſuperficies, but ſhut within, are better old than new; for all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crementitious and ſuperfluous humidity is abſumed in theſe by time, and their natural humidity remains, becauſe of their denſity.</p>
                        <p>Many are beſt in their middle age;
<note place="margin">Qua media a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate meliora.</note> firſt, ſweet; ſecondly, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſavoury; thirdly, ſalt Medicaments. Sweet, becauſe theſe newly gathered are flatulent, by reaſon of their ſuperfluous humidity undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted; and being old, they are bitter.</p>
                        <p>Unſavoury Medicaments alſo being new, abound with ſuperfluous humours, whereby they are flatulent and loathed; being old, they are dead and uſeleſs.</p>
                        <p>Salt Medicaments, laſtly, ought neither to be too old, nor too new; for being too old, by reaſon of their ficcity increaſed, and their humidity abſumed, they are bitter and ſharp; and being new by reaſon of ſuperfluous humidity, they trouble and ſubvert the ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle.</p>
                        <p>Now they are antient or new naturally,
<note place="margin">Vetustum &amp; recens non om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus aequum.</note> from a like number of dayes, months, or years. Whence an equal age or newneſs cannot be given to all, becauſe all do not endure altogether the ſame number of dayes; but ſome grow old ſooner, and ſome later.</p>

                        </head>
                        <p>A Good purging Medicament may be diſcerned from an ill one by the place; and that either from the native place where Plants grow; or from another place near to, or remote from the Plant; or from a place near to, or remote from the Sun; or from a place expoſed to its heat, or obtenebrated and hindred of its heat. Neither is it of ſmall moment to know the place from whence the Plant ſprung up, becauſe from thence together with its Aliment, it partook of ſuch virtue as Nature had imparted to that place, (<hi>Gal. cap.</hi> 1. <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>de ſympt. cauſ.</hi>) For a Tree transferred from <hi>Perſia</hi> into <hi>Numidia</hi> and <hi>Egypt,</hi> doth not onely depoſe its malign quality, but conveyed to us, is wholſome, and may bring forth gratefull and wholſome Fruits.</p>
                        <p>Now the place in which Plants, and Medicaments taken from Plants grow, is either hollow, and polluted with dung, clay, and other naughty vapours, or free from all ſtrong ſmelling inquinations, or hot or cold, moyſt or dry.</p>
                        <p>In the free place, which admits of no heap, or filth of dunghils,
<note place="margin">Cloacarum ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor ac putredo plantas inſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres reddit.</note> Medicamental Plants, as alſo Nutritive, acquire the property due and convenient to their nature, while by an attractive faculty they draw the humour familiar to them out of the earth, and convert it to their nutriment; as thoſe that are nouriſhed with ſweet, attract ſweet hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours; bitter, bitter humours; and ſuch as are nouriſhed by ſalt and nitrous humours, attract ſalt and nitrous humours.</p>
                        <p>But in a place not free, but inquinated, as the ſuburban Gardens,
<note place="margin">Hortorum ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urbanorum in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalubria olera.</note> which ſmell more of ſmoke and dung than earth, (otherwiſe unapt to nouriſh Melons and Cucumbers) do not acquire the property due to their kinde and nature, but to the mixture of dung, and other things; and therefore Melons, Lettices, and other herbs growing in ſuch pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trid places, are more unwholſome; and all Medicaments that grow in a free place, better, and therefore the rather to be choſen.</p>
                        <p>Now thoſe that are hot immoderately, ſprung in too hot a place,
<note place="margin">Calida loco ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lido nata, qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia.</note> are worſe; as alſo cold in too cold a place: for the ſimilitude of the place to the Plants intendeth and increaſeth their quality and maligni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, diffimilitude tempers and repreſſes them. Whence thoſe that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound with excrementitious humidity, grow and are nouriſhed in moſt humid places, as Turbith, Hermodactyls, Polypody, becauſe through the humidity of the ground, ſiccity and acrimony are retun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, as it is known from Bartram, or Pelitory, Water-pepper, and others.</p>
                        <pb n="44" facs="tcp:37350:54"/>
                        <p>The vicinity alſo, and ſociety of one Plant to another, makes the quality ſometimes better, and ſometimes worſe, and is not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected in the election of Medicaments.</p>
                        <p>Lupines makes the Vine better; which if they be ſown beſides, it cauſeth it to bring forth ſweet cluſters. The Radiſh root alſo makes Hermodactyls better.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Epithymus</hi> that grows about Thyme is good; that which is gathered about Baſil is naught; Polypody of the Oak is very good, that which is gathered off old walls is naught.</p>
                        <p>The tree Caſſia alone in the field is not worth a Peaſe cod. We have before, to wit, in the 8. Chapter, ſhewed the contrary of <hi>Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cynthis;</hi> for ſome become better by vicinity and number, others worſe.</p>
                        <p>Now from a ſubſolar place, or from a place nearer to, or more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote from the Sun or Stars, ſome are better or worſe: ſo the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ental Senny, Illyrium and Florentine Flower-de-luce, the Spaniſh Angelica, the Cretian Thyme, the Judaical Bitumen, the Ethiopian Cummin, the Macedonian Parſley, the Mompelian Maidenhair, the Arabian Cotten weed, or <hi>Staechades,</hi> the Thebane Poppy, the Scythian <hi>Amomum,</hi> the Chian Maſtick, the Damaſcen Prune, the Calabrian Manna, the Rhabarb, that is, the root of <hi>Barbary;</hi> thoſe Oranges that are brought out of <hi>France</hi> are judged beſt, becauſe of the property of the earth, and the virtue of the celeſtial cauſe.</p>
                        <p>But there can be little judgement given from the aſpect and vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the Sun and Stars, and the ſelection of the malignant from the benign thereby is not ſafe, becauſe we can hardly know from what place every Medicament comes, or whether they grow near others or no, or what good or malignant Star reſpects every one, we muſt credit thoſe that effode the roots, and gather the other parts of the Plants.</p>
                        <p>And as the number in ſome doth change, intend, or remit their virtue and quality, as one onely Apple of <hi>Colocynthis</hi> manifeſts, ſo alſo doth magnitude or parvity; for the virtue of the Earth and Plant is diffuſed, and in many is more remiſs, but coacted into one Plant, or one Fruit more valid. Yet many Fruits are commended for their parvitude, as Capers; and many Seeds for their magnitude, as <hi>Garthamus.</hi>

                        <head>CHAP. XXII. <hi>Of the choyce of purging Medicaments taken from their faculties.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p>WE have briefly, but clearly, ſhewed how purging Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ought to be ſelected, by a judgement taken from their ſubſtance, proper temperament, ſecond qualities proceeding from their temperament, from their diſpoſition extrinſecally acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, from the circumſtances of place, time, number, magnitude, and parvity; it reſts that we diſpatch briefly what may be ſpoken, as to that choyce which is taken from their purging faculty; which though it be helped by the firſt and ſecond qualities, yet (ſaith <hi>Meſue</hi>) its original is celeſtial; and it hath that ſpecifical property, whereby the Medicament received into the ventricle, and ſolicited by our heat, attracts to it ſelf the humour familiar to its nature, as we have noted elſewhere, from the veins and paſſages of our body, not perceived by the ſenſes, into the belly; and then Nature laden with the burthen of the Medicament, and the humours attracted, prepares a way to excretion, either by vomit at the mouth, or by dejection at the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour parts. Whence there are two kinds of purging Medicaments, the one a vomiting or ejective Medicament, the other dejective; which diſtinction is taken from the manner of excretion or vacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                        <p>Now the dejective is more deſirable than the ejective, becauſe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath alotted the inferiour courſe to expell Excrements, the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour to receive Aliments. Whence it frequently happens, that Nature acting ſpontaneouſly, and provoked by no morbifical cauſe, doth abundantly carry and deject excrementious humours at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour parts; and ſometimes irritated by the virtue of the Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it ſelf ejective, and by the force of the ſwelling humour,
<note place="margin">

                              </gap>ndi.</note> it ejects both Medicament and humours by the mouth. Whence it comes to paſs, that ejective are ſometimes better than dejective Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments, eſpecially to thoſe whoſe firſt region of the body or upper ventricle is ſtuffed with much choler, which by reaſon of its levity and the facility of the traction, may more eaſily and ſooner be extru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by vomit. <hi>Hippocrates</hi> alſo commends vomit to them that are ſlender, eſpecially in Summer, <hi>Becauſe for the moſt part they are cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerick; ſlender folks,</hi> (ſaith he, <hi>Aphor.</hi> 6. <hi>lib.</hi> 4.) <hi>are prone to vomit, and are to be purged upward; but take heed in Winter.</hi> And (<hi>Aphor.</hi> 40. <hi>lib.</hi> 4) <hi>in Summer it is better to purge upwards, in Winter down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards:</hi> for the groſs and cold humour collected in Winter, is more eaſily educed by the inferiour parts; and therefore the skilfull Phyſician uſes ſometimes ejective, and ſometimes dejective Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:37350:55"/>as the condition of the ſwelling humour requires, or the nature of the diſeaſed will bear. For <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith, (<hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de loc. affect.</hi>) <hi>That no man ſhould be compelled to vomit, unleſs he be prone to vomit; and that conſuming men are never to be purged by vomit, nor they who have a ſtrait Thorax, or narrow paſſage.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But if a Vomit be preſcribed to whom it is convenient,
<note place="margin">Quae vomito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria ſeligenda.</note> then let it be provoked by thoſe Medicaments which ſubvert the ventricle without great moleſtation, and not with white Hellebor, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to <hi>Galens</hi> advice, <hi>(lib. quos, quando, &amp; quibus medicam.)</hi> leſt any veſſel of the breaſt ſhould break. And much leſs by Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, whereby crafty beguilers kill many, and ſometimes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as it is to be ſeen in that admirable Hiſtorie in <hi>Cornelius Gem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma, c.</hi> 4. <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>pag.</hi> 239. <hi>linea</hi> 14.</p>
                        <p>The ſame choyce is to be obſerved in other Purges, that we uſe the more benign, analogical to the morbifical humours; <hi>For we ought to give a choler purging Medicament to the cholerick,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Galen</hi>) <hi>a flegm purging Medicament to the flegmatick, and a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy purging Medicament to the melancholick; otherwiſe we of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend Nature.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Now there is no blood purging Medicament preſcribed either to purge blood by the mouth or fundament, becauſe</hi> (as <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith, (<hi>cap.</hi> 6. <hi>lib. de purg. medicam. facult.</hi>) <hi>that were to jugulate, not to purge men.</hi>

<note place="margin">Note.</note> which after ſome reſpite, and interval, he took up again, and found that all the blood drew towards the herb: whence he conjectured, that the herb would attract blood from the body; and finding it true, by experience made upon one he met, as he had before imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, he afterwards transferred the herb to evil uſes: yet he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, he never did ſhew that herb to any, (of which there was much in that Countrey.)

<pb n="47" facs="tcp:37350:55"/>corroborate the ventricle: Senna, Cetrarch, to the ſpleen: Hermo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dactyls, and Ground pine, to the Arteries: Sage and Roſemary to the nerves. Yet theſe ſimple Medicaments are not ſo much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtringed to thoſe parts, but they may be applyed conveniently to others.</p>
                        <p>And as many Medicaments, as well ſimple as compound, do pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly corroborate ſome certain part by ſome familiarity; and ſo ſome on the contrary do manifeſtly deſtroy and hurt ſome parts of the body, as the Sea hare the Lungs, Cantharides the Liver, Hem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock the Brain, as it is well obſerved by <hi>Galen, cap.</hi> 1. <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>compoſ. medic. per genera.</hi>

For thoſe aliments which we daily aſſume unto our bodies, if they want their acquired preparation, as roſting, boyling, or the like, are rather fit for beaſts than men; becauſe it is naturall, and therefore belongs to cattell to feed upon the fruits of the earth, as hay, pulſe, &amp;c. onely prepared by the worke of nature. As alſo the Sea affords neceſſary food agreeable to nature, both for
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:37350:56"/>great and ſmall fiſhes. But the earth, unwilling to afford ſuch a bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of her ſelfe, doth render up her fruits ſomewhat incongruous to humane nature without a preparation, and will not afford either nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment nor aliment to man without the long expectation, and indefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigable labours of the Husbandman, who after much paines rending up the bowells thereof, and caſting in his ſeed, proves as it were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull by bringing forth corne, which at the firſt ſprouting forth becomes ſuitable nutriment to many birds of the aire, and four footed beaſts of the field, but to man in no wiſe without preparation, by firſt making bread of it with Water and Leaven: For as that great Attorney Generall of Nature ſaith <hi>(lib. de veter. Med.) That the ſame meat and drink which ſuffices beaſt and Horſes, and other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as they proceed out of the earth, raw and undigeſted</hi> (viz.) <hi>fruits, hearbs, &amp;c. by which theſe are nouriſhed, and on which they live, cannot ſuffice man, nor agree with his conſtitution; For this is apparent, that one body differs from another, one nature from another, and one aliment another.</hi> As the ſame Author hath it <hi>(lib. de flatib.)</hi> for one and the ſame thing cannot be commodious and uſefull, (as to Nutriment) to all kinds of living creatures, but ſome are more convenient than others.</p>
                        <p>Thoſe meats and drinks which are our daily ſuſtenance,
<note place="margin">Phyſicians out firſt Schoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſters in teaching us to make bread.</note> were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented and conſulted of with mature deliberation by <hi>quondam</hi> Phiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, who inſtructed us, their poſterity, to make bread of Corne, by being firſt ſeparated from the chaffe, then ground, ſifted, kneaded and laſt of all baked.</p>
                        <p>If therfore meat and drinke being familiar, as it were to the tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rament and nature of man need preparation, before they be aſſumed, then much more ſimple Medicaments, or thoſe Ingredients which are required to the making up of a Medicine. For there is no Queſtion to be made of compound Medicines, becauſe they cannot be ſuch, till they be firſt conoited and fitted by art, and due preparation.</p>
                        <p>Now amongſt ſimples,

Therefore according to <hi>Actuarius,</hi> 'twas ordained by nature to overcome, and not to be overpowered; hence it is, that every purging Medicine hath ſomething offenſive and ungratefull to the ſtomack, by conſequence therefore it needs preparation and correction before it be exhibited, that its no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xious quality may be removed, and its vertues more approximated to the nature of our conſtitutions, and that its operation may be better and leſſe trouble ſome to the Patient: For nothing is produced out of the wombe of Nature, which ought to be diſhed up to man without ſuch preparation, as it requires.</p>
                        <p>Medicaments are prepared,
<note place="margin">The reaſon why Medicines are to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared.</note> that they may be more co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modious for uſe and compoſition, for thereby they become either more acceptable, more valid, more wholeſome, or more miſcible, according to the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of <hi>Sylvius.</hi> It is our cuſtome to uſe roots and hearbs, waſhed and boyled, and not raw, as alſo powders, infuſions, juices, diſtilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, liquors, decoctions of certaine vegetables, and other materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alls,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:37350:57"/>and not integrall plants, for by this, either we take away ſome noxious quality or other from the medicine. As when vipers are made medicinall, we uſe firſt well to ſmite and bombaſte them with rods, and then cut off their heads and tailes, and thereby they become leſſe venemous, or elſe by it we detect the deſirable faculty. As Goates blood is more efficacious in diminiſhing the ſtone, if the Goat be fed with Saxifrage and Grumwell, or elſe by it, we acquire a new fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, as when we nouriſh a female creature, a ſhe Goat, or Aſſe, with Scammony, Milkweed, or other purging hearbs, that its milkineſſe may attaine a purgative faculty.</p>

                        <p>PReparation of Medicaments in generall is made three manner of wayes,
<note place="margin">Praeparationes tantum tres ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerales.</note> either by addition, detraction, or immutation: by addition, and ſo Agarick is prepared, by adding Ginger and Wine, Coriander-ſeed with Vineger, Vipers fleſh with Bread and Dill: by detraction Cantharides are prepared, their feet and wings cut off; Barly, by taking away its droſſe and chaffe; Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds, by being blanched; roots by waſhing, cleanſing, and cutting off the Fibres, their pith and woody ſubſtance taken out: by immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when the Medicament it ſelf, is ſo prepared by a certain artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall knowledge and Art, that its noxious faculty is either removed or corrected, and the ſubſtance thereby made better to uſe alone, or compound with others. But this artificiall preparation requires two other manner of wayes, either the adjection of thoſe things that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, or the detraction of thoſe things that hurt. So Caſtor and Saf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fron is added to Opium, that its maligne power may be amended; ſo <hi>Lapis Lazuli,</hi> is appointed to be burned before it be put into <hi>Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctio Alkermes</hi> or Kermeticall confection, that its purging faculty may be taken away.</p>
                        <p>Old <hi>Meſue</hi> delivers foure other particular modes of preparation,
<note place="margin">Quatuor prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parationes ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundum Meſ.</note> coction, lotion, infuſion, and grinding, to which our later Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians have aded many more, as lotion, purgation, infuſion, hume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation, maceration, diſſolution, clarification, emollition, cola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, extraction, ſolution, digeſtion, fermentation, tundation, pulverization, frixion, aſſation, liquation, putrefaction, inſolation, extinction, refrigeration, deſpumation, exſiccaſion, induration, diſtillation, digeſtion, mixtion, ſcapulation, extraction conſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, duration. But in generall, humectation, maceration, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, emollition and what ever is humified or mollified, with water or moiſture, is contained under infuſion; Pulverization and ſcraping, and whatſoever is made ſmooth with ſcraping, rubbing, &amp;c. is comprehended under tundation, calefaction, uſtion, frixion,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:37350:57"/>and what others are prepared with fire and heat, is comprehended un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der coction: and thus the infinite manner of preparing may be redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to ſome few generall heads.</p>
                        <p>Theſe ſubſequent modes of preparations are for the moſt part fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent with Chymiſts, calcination, digeſtion, fermentation, diſtilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, circulation, ſublimation, fixation, to diſtillation pertaines exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, exhaltation, circulation, cohobation, rectification, they call a double diſtillation a cohobation, when the diſtilled liquor is pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red upon the ſame Ingredient, and diſtilled over againe.</p>
                        <p>But to omit theſe Chymicall tearmes of preparations, which is better to know, than make experience of. We will proſecute more particularly the accuſtomed preparation of Medicines, the whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Remedies of Phyſicians preſcript, that we may ſecurely and without danger make uſe of to the depelling of our diſtempers, and the ſafeguarde of our families, which be ſuch as Apothecaries prepare daily and openly before all mens eyes, and places them in conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient pots and glaſſes and other veſſells in their ſhops, either for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent uſe or perſeverance, till occaſion ſerves: and of thoſe the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician ſelects for the neceſſity of the exigent, ſometimes this, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times that, and preſcribes how much is moſt convenient to be admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred for the expelling of the diſeaſe. Now the Phyſicians work is not to prepare theſe Medicins, but to preſcribe them, hence it is, that Apothecaries are tearmed the Phyſicians hand (for it is better to commit our lives into the hands of two than one,) to operate ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Preſcript, for if the Phyſician alone ſhould preſcribe, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare, and afford Medicines, It were too great a trouble to ly upon one mans ſhoulders. Beſides, he hath power to ſave or kill, and not to be liable to puniſhment, by Law. Which, is an Impious and Intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable thing, an act not to be indured, therefore it was ordained, that Apothecaries ſhould be appointed, who ought to prepare and preſerve Medicaments, and to diſtribute them out in certain quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, according to the Doctors Judgment and decree.</p>
                        <p>But I would not abrogate Chymicall remedies totally from Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecaries ſhops, for there are many of them of excellent vertue,
<note place="margin">Chimica reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia non negligenda.</note> to the diſſipating of many crabbed diſtempers: but they are ſuch as the learned and skilfull onely ſhould uſe, and not ignorant Mountebanks,
<note place="margin">Qui debeant uti chymicis remediis.</note> and wandering Quacks and deceivers, who ſcarce know how to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare a Medicin, yet will proclaime themſelves to the world to be more skilfull than <hi>Galen</hi> and <hi>Hyppocrates.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But to returne to our intended purpoſe, I ſay, there are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers modes of preparing Medicins, which that I may proſecute in order, I will begin with Lotion, afterwards I will extend my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to thoſe ingredients which are ſimply prepared with water, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, when medicinall with juice or other liquor; then I will demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate what preparations are made with contunding, grinding, or ſcraping, afterwards I will explaine what preparation heat performes, and I will add to theſe, thoſe that are finiſhed with a mixed manner.</p>

                        </head>
                        <p>LOtion by learned <hi>Sylvius</hi> is accounted the laſt manner of prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
<note place="margin">Primus praepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rationis modus &amp; cur.</note> by ſome, the middle; but by us the firſt; becauſe moſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients, before they will ſerve our uſe, before any other preparation can be made, ought to be waſhed, though ſome, I confeſſe, are not to be waſhed till they be burned, roſted, or ſcraped.</p>
                        <p>This Lotion is twofold,
<note place="margin">Duplex Lotio.</note> the one a ſuperficiary Lotion, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts the adherent filth, from the ſuperficies of roots, hearbs and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Medicinall materialis, and It is common to all other things, which being inquinated with clay, or other pollutions, are to be waſhed: the other is more intimate, which dilates it ſelf both without and within, and thorow the whole ſubſtance: Now this preparation is made in water or other liquor for this end and purpoſe, to remove ſome notious quality, or to introduce ſome good one, as the diſeaſe it ſelf, the nature of the diſeaſe, or the occaſion requires.</p>
                        <p>The Ingredient or materiall to be waſhed is either obdurate, ſolid, or ſtony, as the ſubſtance of ſhells, bones, ſtones, concrete Juices, dry gums and metalls; or ſuch as are of themſelves liquid, as Turpenttne, Oyle, or ſuch as are eaſy to be melted, as wax, pitch, roſin, butter; or ſuch as are diſſoluble, as Lime-ſtones, Bole arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niack, Lytharge of God or Silver.</p>
                        <p>Thoſe things that are hard and ſolid, before waſhing ought to be pulverized, or burned, and ſo bruiſed, that they cannot be grinded without uſtion, as Ivory, and Harts-horne, and ſo the water or liquor may reach, waſh, and purge every part.</p>
                        <p>Thoſe that will eaſily melt as Wax and Roſin, &amp;c. ought firſt to be warmed, that being melted they may more eafily yield, or be made more pliable; if they will eaſily diſſolve of themſelves, they are to be ſprinkled with ſome water or juice, and then waſhed, if liquid of themſelves, they are to be waſhed by continuall ſtirring and commi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xing water or other liquor with the body of the thing to be waſhed.</p>
                        <p>The liquors in which this Lotion is made, is either pure water, as fountain, or rain-water, or medicinall, as ſulphurous Sea water, or Bituminous or ſome other humour, as milk, honey, vinegar, the juice of Plants, diſtilled water and decoctions of ſimple medicaments. This Lotion is either much and hard, or little and light, or a <hi>medium,</hi> or mean: for the things that are waſhed for the detraction of their filth ought either to be waſhed ſtrongly or lightly, and the water ſo off changed, till it remaines pure, and all its impurity ſegregated and eje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.</p>
                        <pb n="53" facs="tcp:37350:58"/>
                        <p>Thoſe that are waſhed in a medicinall liquor, ſhould lye in the ſame a certain ſpace, according to appointment, as a whole night, or the ſpace of ſome houres, that they may attract the greater power from the liquor, or looſe their malignant quality: This preparationis in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juriouſly called by <hi>Sylvius,</hi> A Lotion, when it is rather an Infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion or Maceration, or rather as another hath it, an Imbution,
<note place="margin">Imbutio quid.</note> for the liquor ſeldom or never adds faculties to the Medicin, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther detracts from it, as we ſee in Rhabarb and others ſteeped in wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; whoſe purgative faculty remaines by being tranſmitted into the Liquor.</p>
                        <p>Yet are they not waſhed, that they may ſo loſe their vertues, but increaſe them,
<note place="margin">Aloe cur ablua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur.</note> and ſo in <hi>Meſues</hi> judgement Aloes ſhould be wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in odoriferous water, that it may coroborate the more, or in ſome purging juice or decoction (as juice of Roſes, or the infuſion thereof) that it may with more celerity relax the belly; yet it is not alwayes waſhed, that its purging faculty may be intended, but rather that its heat may be remitted; as when it is waſhed in the water of Endive, Succory, or ſuch like, that it may not too much exeſtuate the liver.</p>
                        <p>Lotion therefore <hi>ex conſequenti,</hi> either adds to, or detracts from medicinall materialls, and cauſes not onely the filth to be wiped off, but alſo mitigates in ſome their acrimony, in others deſtroyes their malignity, and dulls their violence, and makes them better, either to be aſſumed or applyed.</p>
                        <p>Now that Metalls may be waſhed,
<note place="margin">Metallica ut abluenda.</note> they ought to be pulverized ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſmall, and then to be put into pure water, or any other Medicinall liquor, and to be continually ſtirred with a wooden <hi>Spatula</hi> for a whole day, and in the morning following the water to be powred out, and other water put on, and agitated as before, till the water thats pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red off be cleere, and by this means Metalls loſe their Mordacity and Acrimony (if they have any ſuch quality) for <hi>Tutia</hi> waſhed thus is void of all mordacity, and therefore we uſe it,
<note place="margin">Tutiae lotic.</note> for the fluxions of the eyes, ſo likewiſe many other Metalls being thus waſhed, loſe their Acrimonious quality. As <hi>Galen</hi> ſhewes at large, (4. <hi>Comp. Med. Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. c.</hi> 2.)</p>
                        <p>The Ancients were wont to quench burnt braſſe in Aſſes milk two or three times over,
<note place="margin">Cadmia lotio.</note> then pulverized it in a morter with water powred on it, and ſo dryed it againe, and ſo preſerved it to dry up ulcers of the eyes, and drive away fluxions.</p>
                        <p>Ceruſs is often waſhed in milk, ſometimes in rain-water,
<note place="margin">Ceruſae lotio.</note> and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in diſtilled water, as the Phyſician orders it.</p>
                        <p>The uſuall cuſtome of our Apothecaries in the preparation of ſteele is to waſh or ſprinkle its duſt with vineger,
<note place="margin">Chalybis lotio vulgaris.</note> according to the <hi>Arabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> cuſtome, afterwards they dry it on a large marble in the hot Sun, dryed, they bruiſe it again, and put on vineger as before, and ſo they do ſeven times, but this is not ſimply Lotion, but a manifeſt prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, yet is the duſt of iron more laborioufly prepared by Alcumiſts,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:37350:59"/>of which they make their <hi>Crocus Martis,</hi> but of this we have ſpoken one where.</p>
                        <p>The Lotion of Lead is thus,
<note place="margin">Plumbi lotio.</note> firſt burnt well in a Crucible, then pulverized in a Leaden morter, with a Leaden peſtill, with rain-wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, till the water wax thick, like blackiſh clay, then the liquor muſt be ſtrained, dryed, made into balls and kept.</p>
                        <p>To preſerve unctious ſubſtances,
<note place="margin">Adioum &amp; me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductarum ablu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio.</note> firſt the Adeps; or <hi>Medulla</hi> muſt be melted, then ſtrained from the droſſy Membranes, afterwards waſhed well in water, till it appears pure and cleere.</p>
                        <p>The preparation of a Wolfs Liver conſiſts in ablution &amp; ſiccation.
<note place="margin">Jecoris Lupi praeparatio.</note> Firſt, let it be waſhed over and over, in odoriferous wine; in which wormewood hath firſt been boyled, being thus waſhed according to Art; Let it be well dryed in an Oven, then afterwards laid in a dry place with dry Wormwood or Mint.</p>
                        <p>This Lotion is by ſome highly commended, as of ſufficient robo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to ballance the weakneſs of the Liver, which is naturally ſo, by reaſon of its ill odor and inſuavity.</p>
                        <p>The inteſtines alſo of a Wolfe muſt be waſhed and prepared after the ſame manner,
<note place="margin">Inteſtini Lupi praeparatio.</note> ſave that they muſt be dryed in the North-wind, they are commended by ſome learned Doctors, for ſome ſpeciall qualities in or againſt the Cholick paſſions.</p>

                        </head>
                        <p>BY Lotion (of which we have treated in the former Chapter) the filth and corruption mixed with Medicinall materialls is waſhed off, but their ſuperfluous and noxious parts are not purged thereby, for French Barley, though a thouſand times waſhed, will ſcarce loſe it hilling; nor other ſeeds their chaff and coverings; nor fruits their skins or barks; nor nuts their ſhells: neither can fat onely by waſhing be purged from its Membranes: therefore ſhould be twice cocted, and no more, according to <hi>Hyppocrates</hi> advice, before it be uſed; in generall all Medicaments more or leſſe, ſhould be purged by detra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, which cannot be performed ſo much by Lotion, as by Section, Raſion and fraction, or ſome other Artificiall Induſtry of the hand. Thus the externall part of roots are ſcraped by cutting off their little fibres, or the heart of them (commonly ſo called) taken out of them. Yet ſometimes they are not purged from their barks, but the barks from every part, as from ſuperfluous and uſeleſſe matter: for of the Cinamon-tree the bark only is moſt deſirable, of Ginger the root, of Santall-tree the wood, of Canes the marrow or pith; of Maiden haire, the leaves onely; of the Roſe-tree, the flowers; of Pepper, the ſeed; other parts ſince they are either leſſe uſefull, or ſuperfluous are pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged away.</p>
                        <p>For this reaſon the <hi>Medulla</hi> or pith of <hi>Caſſia Fiſtula</hi> is ſeparated from its cane, Raiſins from their ſtones; Dates from their ſhells; the Colocinth ſeparated from its ſeeds; the hillings from many ſeeds, but from many fruits nothing, the Cortex, <hi>Medulla,</hi> juice, ſeed, and flowers of Citron and Orange are good and uſefull.</p>
                        <p>Whereas Nuts and Almonds are involved in a threefold skin, wherefore they ſhould be thrice purged, the skin which is thick in ſome, is taken away by the firſt; the ſhell is broken, by the ſecond, and the cover next to the kernell is taken away by the third, wherein it is involved.</p>
                        <p>As a Child in a ſheet in the wombe, the uſuall cuſtome is to put Almonds or Nuts into water, and when 'tis ready to boyle, rub them between your fingers, and they will eaſily be cleanſed.</p>

                        <head>CHAP. V. <hi>Of Infuſion.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p>INfuſion is a preparation of certain Medicaments, whereby they are ſliced into ſmall peeces, or bruiſed and ſo ſteeped in a liquor fit and convenient to the Phyſicians intention, and that by the ſpace of one houre or two, or more, dayes or weeks, according to the nature of the Medicament, or the Phyſicians Order: for thoſe that have a hard compact ſubſtance, and a quality firmely inhering in the ſubſtance, ought to be ſteeped or infuſed longer; thoſe that are ſmall and tender, a leſſer ſpace.</p>
                        <p>The uſe of this Infuſion is chiefly threefold, that the maligne force of the Medicine may be regulated, or altogether abſumed, that the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nigne or good quality may be made better, or their vertues tranſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the liquor.</p>
                        <p>Turbith before 'tis uſed,
<note place="margin">Turpethi praepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratio.</note> ought to be ſteeped in new milk, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards dryed, that it may not gripe the bowells, when it is aſſumed. <hi>Mezeorus &amp; laureola</hi> before they be exhibited in any Medicine, ought to be ſteeped in white Wine, and afterwards dryed, that their crabbedneſs might be mitigated.</p>
                        <p>The five opening roots after Lotion ſhould be ſteeped in vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
<note place="margin">Quinque radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum aperien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium praepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio.</note> that they might the eaſier cut viſcid Phlegme, and ſooner de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce humors by the paſſage dedicated to the expelling of humor; Nettle-ſeed,
<note place="margin">Urticae ſemen quibus conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niat.</note> ſteeped in the decoction of the hearb Draconth, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, helpes any ſtopping at the ſtomach, for it is exceeding good for thoſe that are troubled with ſtoppages. It cauſes the throat, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts, by which it paſſeth, to ceaſe to burn or itch.</p>
                        <p>But purging ingredients, and odoriferous ſpices, are uſually in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed in Wine, or Water, or ſome ſuitable decoction, or ſome diſtilled water, or in juices extracted from vegerables, according to the ſeverall ends and purpoſes of the Doctor, that they might loſe their proper qualities, and tranſmit them into the liquor; thus Rha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barb and Agarick are wont to be infuſed, not onely that their vertue might go into the liquor, but that it might have a better and more effectuall operation of the body of him that aſſumes it.</p>
                        <p>The mixture of <hi>Vinum Hypocraticum</hi> is onely the infuſion of Cina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in the beſt Wine,
<note place="margin">Vinum Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craticum.</note> with the diſſolution of ſugar, ſo much as will dulcorate it: There is alſo ſome Ginger mixed with it by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecaries, that it may the better content and pleaſe the drinkers pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late.</p>
                        <p>So alſo <hi>Gummi Ammoniacum,
<note place="margin">Gummorum in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſio.</note> Galbanum, Oppoponax,</hi> and <hi>Sagape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num</hi> are macerated, ſteeped or infuſed in Wine, or Vineger, to bring down their conſiſtences, that the filth mixed therewith, may be ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:37350:60"/>from them by colature, before they are to be uſed in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions of Electuaries or Plaiſters, or for other uſes.</p>
                        <p>So flowers of Violets, Roſes, and Water-Lillyes,
<note place="margin">Florum Inſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſio.</note> are infuſed in warme water, till their vertues be tranſmitted, and the colature dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corated with a ſufficient quantity of ſugar, to bring it into the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency of a ſyrup.</p>

                        <p>HUmectation, Infection, or Triture are wont to be reduced to infuſion or Immerſion: And Irrigation, or Inſperſion to Hume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation; for thoſe Medicaments that are liquored, with Vineger, Milk, Water or other humor grow moiſt, or are humected, that they may more comodiouſly and conveniently be uſed and commixed with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
                        <p>Now humectation,
<note place="margin">What Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caments need humectation.</note> is abſolute neceſſary to all forraign Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which being brought to us from far Regions, are hard, and dry, their juice being evaporated, and therefore we reſartiate their native humidity, or cheriſh and defend that ſmall relique of it that is left, by a light immerſion or irrigation, or oftentimes by repoſing and keeping them in a coole place, as when we lay and preſerve <hi>Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia</hi> in a cellar, Venetian Treacle in a leaden pot, &amp;c. that their ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues may not ſo ſoon be exhaled.</p>

                        <p>Humectation alſo is very neceſſary for the preſervation of fruits, and blaunching of them, from their skins and hulls. As Almonds, that they may be enucleated, are firſt to be ſcalded in hot water, Pine nutts and other fruits and nutts before they can be preſerved, muſt be ſteeped, moiſtned, and macerated in water, that their acrimony and bitterneſs may be abated; for any fruit that hath any apparant quality of acrimony, by a frequent immerſion in water or other liquor, doth waxe more mild.</p>
                        <p>Camphire, Colocynth, <hi>Euphorbium,</hi>

                        <p>MEdicaments in a rationall ſenſe, cannot well be ſaid to be nouriſhed, but in a Philoſophicall ſenſe they may; as when a medicament is augmented, by the mutuall appoſition of two, three or more Medicaments, which acretion, the vulgar Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecaryes call Nutrition, and perchance it was indued with this name, becauſe it is as apparantly altered in mixing, as Nutriment in nouriſhing.</p>
                        <p>Now nutrition is not unlike to Humectation,
<note place="margin">Nutrition is Coſin-german to Huniectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> for in both there muſt neceſſarily be mixed ſome liquor or other, which in Humectation is copious, but in Nutrition ſpare, for in the latter, the liquor muſt not be powred on with that quantity, that the forther requires; for when it is once irrigated or ſprinkled, it muſt be preſently dryed, and that either by the Sun, or fire; and againe moyſtned and dryed, and ſo ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigated three or foure times,
<note place="margin">Sarcocolla nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tritia.</note> as the Gum <hi>Sarcocolla</hi> which is nouriſhed with a womans, or Aſſes milk, but if macerated with a copious quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thereof, it preſently diſſolves, and the milk will be ſoure before the Gumme can be dryed.</p>

                        <p>Many roots are irrigated ſometime with Wine, ſometimes with other liquors, that they may ſwell. As Mirabolans with milk, or with any other liquor, correſpondent to the Phyſicians purpoſe and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.</p>

                        <p>Now this breaking of Medicaments is chiefly for three ends.
<note place="margin">The reaſons of pulverization.</note> Firſt, That they may be exactly mixed with others. Secondly, That they may acquire a new faculty. Thirdly, That their malignity may be corrected.</p>
                        <p>The manner of breaking of Medicaments,
<note place="margin">The divers manner of wayes of Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> is different and various, for many are brayed in a ſtone morter, as in Marble, others in Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall morters, as Iron, Braſs, Lead, and ſometimes glaſſe, others in a Wooden morter, as of Box, or <hi>Guajaicum,</hi> with peſtells uſually of the ſame matter, for an Iron peſtell is moſt apt for an Iron morter, a Wooden one, for a Wooden morter, a Leaden, for a Leaden mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and a glaſſe peſtell for a glaſſe morter: Some cannot nor will not be ſo exactly pulverated by beating as by grinding and rubbing, and that upon a ſmooth marble made hollow for that purpoſe, where in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of a peſtell, we uſe a little marble ſtone called a <hi>Mannipulus,</hi> which we hold in our hand, and circumduce it this way, and that way, round the ſtone,
<note place="margin">Gemms.</note> ſo that we leave no part of the Medicamet unrub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed; and after this manner Gemmes and pretious ſtones are made in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to powder, till we can perceive no knobbs with our fingers, which powder ſo brayed, the vulgar call marbled duſt, after which manner alſo thoſe powders ought to be attenuated, which go to the making up of Ophthalmick unguents.</p>
                        <p>Some are brayed and ground with turning ſtones, as Wheat and Barly in a Mill, and ſo a great quantity of hard ſeeds may eaſily and ſpeedily be bruiſed, and grinded to powder.</p>
                        <p>Thoſe Medicaments we prepare onely for coction need but little bruiſing, and thoſe alſo that are of a thin ſubſtance, whoſe vertue is diſſipable, need but little bruiſing alſo, as almoſt all flowers.</p>
                        <p>And thoſe require much bruiſing, that are hard, thick ſolid, ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous, and not eaſy to be broken, as alſo ſuch as partake of a malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:37350:62"/>quality, as Colocinth, the groſſer part whereof aſſumed being not well powdered, inheres in the turning of the Inteſtines, and exul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerates the part, cauſing the bloody flux.</p>
                        <p>Thoſe that confiſt of a meane ſubſtance, as many odoriferous ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, muſt be bruiſed moderately, leaſt their more ſubtill, and odori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferous parts ſhould exhale, and be diſſipated, yet they muſt be bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten very ſmall, when they go to the confection of any electuary; and when we would have them to ſearch and penetrate to the remoteſt parts, then muſt they be beaten very fine, when we would have them to ſtay long in the body; then they muſt be courſer, provided they be not indued with any maligne quality; ſome muſt be bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten very fine and ſmall, that they may ſooner performe their opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and manifeſt their power.</p>
                        <p>Roots and hearbs are ſometimes beaten green, and ſometimes dry, ſometimes raw, ſometimes boyled, for their different ends and uſes, but thoſe muſt alwayes but be bruiſed mode rately, that are to be boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; for alwayes obſerve,
<note place="margin">Note.</note> that a greater Triture is requiſit for roots than leaves, leſſer for fruits, and a meane for ſeeds: For ſeeds require but a contuſion betwixt roots and hearbs.</p>
                        <p>So likewiſe many Medicaments can ſcarce be redacted to powder, unleſs ſomething be mixed with them.
<note place="margin">The husks of Silkwormes.</note> As <hi>Coloquintido fericum cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum,</hi> Camphire, and many more, which onely dilate by beating them alone, unleſſe there be ſome unctious or liquid matter ſuperad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; ſometime we uſe to ſprinkle ſome with wine, other with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſome with oyl and vineger, that they may not only ſooner be brought into powder, but alſo better ſerve our intention.</p>

                        <p>Thoſe in generall that require ſtrong concoction require much Triture, and thoſe that require leſſe concoction, alſo leſſe Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                        <p>And when any Aromaticke Ingredient, or odoriferous ſimples, or Gemms and precious ſtones, are pulverizing, the morter ſhould be covered with a convenient cover, either of wood or leather, leaſt the more ſubtill part ſhould exhale, and their odour decay, and they more ſhould be cloſer covered, when <hi>Euphorbium</hi> or Hellibore are beaten, leaſt the fume ſhould offend the noſtrills, and cauſe importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate ſneezing.</p>

                        <p>Firſt, the roots, woods, and barks of trees,
<note place="margin">Section.</note> are cut off with ſawes and hatchets, and afterwards cut leſs to repoſe in ſhops, and after all reduced into fine powder, that they may ſerve to our uſe; bones, nailes, clawes, hornes, are alſo divided by the ſame inſtruments, that they may be ſold by male piece, and now of late, raſped and ſhaved.</p>
                        <p>But this preparation made by Section may ſeeme remote from the Apothecaries purpoſe, ſince it rather hath reſpect to the ſeller, than the buyer: yet that more nimble Section, by which the unctious ſeeds of cucumbers, citrulls, mellons, pepons, piſtakes, and ſuch like, are excorticated by a knife, neerely concernes them.</p>
                        <p>Many roots ſtalkes and leaves of Plants are cut with a paire of ſheeres before they be bruiſed. That they may be boyled for Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camentall uſes.</p>
                        <p>Tender hearbs are broken from their ſtalks by twineing and pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in the hand, but their dryer parts are not broken till they be ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded together; Mineralls ſometimes are fractured by a fall, oftner by tender knocks and percuſſions.</p>

                        <p>THAT gentle Medicaments might become more whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, and fitter for uſe and Compoſition, they are wont to be altered by convenient Coction,</p>
                        <p>For Coction (<hi>Probl.</hi> 7. <hi>ſect.</hi> 12. <hi>Hip.</hi>) is an Alteration,
<note place="margin">What coction is.</note> and Commutation of the thing boyled: now there are three diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent coctions. Maturation, Elixation and Aſſation, but becauſe Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turation called by the Greeks <hi>Pepanſis,</hi> is a naturall kind of Coction, we will omit it, becauſe we intend onely to treat of Artificiall Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; to which Elixation, Uſtion, Calfaction, Frixion, Deſpuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and what ever acquires mutation by heat may be referred as to its Genus.</p>
                        <p>Now Coction is ſmall, or great, or moderate according to the ſubſtance or vertue of the thing cocted, for ſome, whoſe vertue is diſſolved by long coction, either becauſe tis weak and poſited in the ſuperficies, or becauſe the ſubſtance of it is contained in a rare texture, as ſome ſeeds, many odoriferous ſpices, and moſt flowers, require a light and ſmall. Coction, others on the contrary, whoſe vertue is not eaſily reſolved, either becauſe it is vallid, and firme, or becauſe it reſides in a groſſe or denſe ſubſtance, or becauſe it is poſited in the middle, as in Roots, Woods, Gumms, Stones, and ſharp Medicaments, as Oni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and Garlick, which grow ſweet and mild by Coction, require long and valid Coction; others whoſe ſubſtance, and vertue is poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in a meane between theſe two extreames, as all the three San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalls, Jujubees, Tamarinds, mellow fruits, and many ſeed, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure but a meane and moderate Coction.</p>
                        <p>Now that Coction that is made in liquour of a moderate heat is called Elixation.
<note place="margin">What elixa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is.</note> And that liquor, in which the Medicament is boyled, is for the moſt part water, and that either ſimple, as common wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or Medicinall or compound, to which Lees of Wine, Hydro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:37350:64"/>Milk, Buttermilk, Wine, Vineger, juices of plants, Salt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water, or ſulphureous waters, and all liquors, in which Medicaments are put and boyled, may be reduced.</p>
                        <p>The uſe of this elixation is manifold,
<note place="margin">The benefit of Elixation.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>Firſt, becauſe it reſolves the excrementitious humors of a Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in boyling, and hence Colocynth and Turbith are boyled, that they may not gripe, and torment the belly; but it is quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary with thoſe Medicaments that purge by Leniating, and Lubrica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the belly, and with thoſe that are beſt when they are fulleſt. As <hi>Caſſia</hi> and Tamarinds, for ſuch become worſe by Coction; becauſe thereby their native humidity is diminiſhed, and their purgative fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty deſtroyed.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, It diſſipates all thoſe flatulent groſſe, and corroding hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours that provoke the ventricle to loathing of the ſame, as in <hi>Senna Polipodie, Carthamus, Walworke, &amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thirdly, It breaks all acrimony, violence, and ulcerating facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; as <hi>Meſue</hi> writes of Scammony, which by his preſcript will be better if it be boyled in a ſorbe apple, or in a quince, or roſe water, as all other ſharp ſapors, which become better by Coction.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, It bridles and corrects, the more vehement and maligne attraction of the Medicament, and therefore we boyle white Hellibor, and moſt valid Medicaments, that their violence may be broken, and experience hath taught me, that they become more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nigne, when they are boyled in water, or juice of hearbs, ſeeds, or fruits.</p>
                        <p>Laſtly, Elixation doth very comodiouſly mixe the different quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Medicaments, that one quality, as it were concrete, might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult from them all, which if it be weak in any plant, it muſt be boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led eaſier and lighter; if more potent and valid, more and harder, by how much the ſubſtance of the Medicament is groſſer, and more ſolid: Therefore we firſt boyle the woods, then roots, then ſeeds, then barks, then fruits, and laſt of all flowers on a gentle fire free from ſmoak.</p>
                        <p>This order of Elixation is to be obſerved in the preparation of all Medicaments, eſpecially Apozemes, which are made of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction of roots, leaves, ſeeds, and flowers, dulcorated with Sugar or Syrups.</p>
                        <p>The punctuall time of Coction cannot be defined, as ſome vainely have limited, but left to the judgment of the Artiſt: for ſome require much time of Elixation, others leſſe.</p>

<note place="margin">What Aſſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is.</note> after which manner of preparation, fleſh, roots, and fruits are co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, without any adventitious humour.</p>
                        <p>Now this Aſſation is made divers wayes;
<note place="margin">The manner of Aſſation.</note> for fleſh is decocted at the fire on a ſpit, or in an oven, or an earthen pot, or carbonaded on the coals.</p>

                        <p>Now many Medicaments are dryed before the fire, that they may depoſe their uſeleſs, and retain their ſalutary quality; others, that they may become more mild; others, that they may be eaſier and ſooner pulverated. Rhabarb is ſometimes dryed, that it may be leſs purgative,
<note place="margin">Scylla.</note> and more aſtrictive; as alſo the Sea-onion, that its vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency may be obtunded; whereby <hi>Dioſcorides</hi> ſaith, it offends the Intrals.
<note place="margin">The brains of Sparrows ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite Venery.</note> So alſo Sparrows brains are dryed, that they may be ſooner pulverable, fitly to be mixed with thoſe Medicaments that incite to Venery.</p>

                        <p>MAny Medicaments, eſpecially ſuch as are more ſolid, as Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals, or ſuch as are indued with a malignant quality, are burned before they be fitted for mans uſe. Some alſo are burned, that they may be ſooner pulverated, as bones, horns, claws, flax, and hairs of Animals; others are burned, that they may change their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour; others, that they may obtain a new faculty; and one fit for our purpoſe. Many ſharp Medicaments are ſometimes burned, that they may grow milde, and loſe their Acrimony; others not ſharp, that they may acquire Acrimony. And thus (as <hi>Galen, in prooemio, l.</hi> 9. <hi>ſimpl.</hi>) took notice, that many ſharp Medicaments loſe much heat by burning; and many not ſharp, aſſume and acquire heat thereby. This he proves by the example of Vitriol, which becomes more milde and moderate by uſtion; and ſome not ſharp, become more hot and crude by uſtion, as <hi>Fex vini,</hi> Quick-ſilver, crude Lime,
<note place="margin">Tartar.</note> and many others.</p>
                        <p>Now how the ſame efficient produces contrary effects,
<note place="margin">The reaſon why ſharp Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments by Uſtion loſe their Acrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.</note> Phyſicians thus judge. Acrimony is acquired by heat increaſed to a certain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, which degree ſharp Medicaments exceeding, loſe their Acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony. But ſuch as were not ſharp when they attain to the ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, whether it be the ſecond or third degree, acquire the ſame Acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony; which <hi>Galen</hi> forbids us to uſe; for he commends Braſs bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned whil'ſt it is red, but rejects it when black, becauſe too much burned.</p>
                        <p>Alcumiſts will have Acrimony to be loſt by Uſtion, becauſe of the diſſipation of Sulphur and volatile Salt, and acquired in ſuch as are not ſharp, becauſe of the diſcuſſion of volatile Sulphur, wherein there is little or no Acrimony; and the remanſion of the fixed ſalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, whoſe Acrimony before Uſtion was obtruded and obſcured with Sulphur.</p>
                        <p>There are alſo many manners of burnings,

But beware leſt their noxious and poyſonous vapour in their combuſtion overcome the brain, and ſo hurt the operation. So likewiſe integral Animals that are ſmall, may be burned; but parts onely of great ones, as bones,

                        <p>Many things are oft to be extinguiſhed, as <hi>Lapis Pyrites:</hi> ſome but once, as Galls: and ſome are extinguiſhed of themſelves, without the affuſion of any humid matter.</p>

                           <hi>Weckerus</hi> ſaith, that Quickſilver may be extinguiſhed with mans faſting ſpittle; yet things not ignified are improperly ſaid to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed, but be mended and prepared by faſting Spittle, and men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by Sage; for Spittle makes it more apt to be incorporated with other mixtures, Sage amends, corrects and aſſwages its fierceneſs; for Sage is ſo called, from its preſervative faculty, <hi>Salvia,</hi> as it were <hi>Salvatrix,</hi> for it much roborates the brain and nerves, which the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levolent faculty of Quickſilver offends, which ſhould be mended with the juice of Sage.</p>
                        <p>A lump or maſs of Gold often burned in the fire,
<note place="margin">Aqua extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionis auri.</note> is ſometimes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed in common water, which water is good for ſuch as have the bloody Flux, to ſhut the orifices of the veſſels, and for the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prous to roborate their principal parts, and exhilerate their ſpirits; for it is not a raſh conceit that Gold as well refreſhes the internals, as the externals.</p>
                        <p>As the water wherein Steel hath often been extinguiſhed, is uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to drive away many affects, ſo Steel it ſelf beaten to duſt, burned and extinguiſhed in Vinegar, is excellent for many uſes; of which more elſwhere.</p>
                        <p>The virtue of Extinction is ſuch, that it attracts and retains the virtues of the humour in which it is extinguiſhed. So <hi>Cadmia,</hi> or <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pis Galaminaris,</hi> is ſometimes extinguiſhed in Wine, ſometimes in

                        <p>CAlfaction is a certain manner of preparing Medicaments,
<note place="margin">Calfactio quid.</note> as well ſimple as compound, whereby they are neither boyled, nor burned, but moderately calefyed either in the ſun, or by the fire, or by the heat of ſome putrid matter, that theſe may be ſtrained, mollified, and mixed more commodiouſly, or that they may be uſed more eaſily and happily. So an infuſed Medicament is calefied be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it be ſtrained, not onely that all its quality may be tranſmitted into the liquor, but that the liquor may more readily-permeate, and wholly draw out.</p>
                        <p>Apothecaries do ſucceſsfully give hot Glyſters preſcribed for ſuch as labour in the Collick, if it proceed not from choler; warm ones to ſuch as are ſick of a Feaver, not that their grief ſhould wax hotter, but to mitigate it, and help the motion of Nature, and the excluſion of the humour upward may be more eaſy. Scarce any thing actually cold ſhould be exhibited, whether the remedy be applyed or aſſumed. Alſo Baths, and the very Linnen ſick folks uſe, ſhould be moderately warmed. Many Medicaments alſo muſt be calefied, that they may more eaſily be broken, mixed, diſſolved, and ſtrained.</p>
                        <p>Inſolation is ſo like and near to Calfaction,
<note place="margin">Inſolatio quid.</note> that the one may eaſily ſupply the others courſe and place, for they both promiſe the ſame effect. And it is like a certain coction,
<note place="margin">Hydromel vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſum quomo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do fiat.</note> when Hydromel is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefied by being ſet in the Sun forty dayes whil'ſt the Dog-ſtar rules; for being more concoct, it may be a taſte like Wine. Yet doth not this Art onely make it become like Wine,
<note place="margin">What Hydro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel is.</note> but that which is prepared of four pints of running water, and one pound of honey, muſt be ſo long cocted before Inſolation, till a raw egge may ſwim above it; which we call Hydromel.</p>
                        <p>Now Conſerves are inſolated or calefied in the Sun, that all their parts may be fermented together, and their more humid matter diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſed; eſpecially ſuch as are prepared of cold leaves and flowers, and ſhould be kept a long time, which will be a means to hinder their working up.</p>
                        <p>The juice of the herb <hi>Scylla,</hi> by <hi>Galens</hi> advice, (<hi>cap. ult. lib. de puere epileptico</hi>) muſt be drawn out by Inſolation or Coction in the Sun; when the Air is obſcure, it may be extracted with fire; and ſuch Medicaments as by the inſtitution of Winter cannot be inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:37350:68"/>may be dryed by the Fire in Winter, by the Sun in Summer.</p>
                        <p>Many Oils may be made by the infuſion of flowers, and permix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of other things, and may be inſolated for the ſpace of more or fewer dayes, as the quantity and faculty of the thing infuſed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires. For things more hot and dry need little or no Inſolation, cold and moyſt longer Inſolation.</p>
                        <p>Vinegar altered by flowers,
<note place="margin">Vinegar of Roſes.</note> muſt be prepared after the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. For Roſe leaves ſhould be more inſolated; Elder flowers a ſhorter time; as alſo that Vinegar which admits of Garlick, Mint, the flowers of Betony, and Gilliflowers.</p>
                        <p>The Refrigeration alſo of Medicaments pertains to the Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cary;
<note place="margin">Refrigeratio.</note> for he refrigerates ſuch things as he would have to congeal as jelly; as alſo ſuch things as are after coction hard, he repoſes in his Shop, as ſolid Electuaries, dry Conſerves, and Plaſters.

                        <p>And becauſe things are putrid from an external heat,
<note place="margin">Menſis Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophicus Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micorum.</note> Putrefaction is a kinde of Coction; as when ſome medicamental matter is left in a Vial occinded in dung, or as Alcumiſts ſay, a Horſes belly (for they give feigned names to their feigned art) for the ſpace of thirty, and ſometimes forty dayes, the laſt term whereof is called by them the Philoſophical month; and the Liquor of this Putrefaction, menſtruous, or Putrefaction finiſhed in a months ſpace.</p>
                        <p>The Alcumiſts own this kinde of preparation,
<note place="margin">Menſtruum quid Chymicis.</note> as peculiar to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: but <hi>Galen,</hi> many years before they were hatched, taught how to putrifie the Gem <hi>Calcitis,</hi> and <hi>Litargie,</hi> obruted with dung after they were put into a new pot with Vinegar.

                        <p>Fermentation is not ſo proper to Medicaments,
<note place="margin">Fermentatio.</note> as to Meats and Drinks: for a lump of Dough is fermented, or leavened, that it may make more pleaſant and wholſome Bread.</p>

                        <p>Alcumiſts have their fermentation alſo, which they ſometimes call Vivification, and ſometimes Reſuſcitation; for thereby they ſay, that the matter periſhed is as it were reſuſcitated from the dead, and acquires new virtues.</p>

                        <p>MEdicaments are wont to be variouſly changed before they be exhibited: for the moſt part, when whole Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments will not ſerve, they are prepared by ſome triture, or diſſolution in ſome liquor or other.
<note place="margin">

                              </gap>.</note> Now this diſſolution is a certain triture, whereby Medicaments, as well ſimple as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound, are diſſolved in ſome fit humour to a moderate conſiſtency, and ſometimes ſmaller, ſometimes thicker, according to the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians purpoſe.</p>
                        <p>Now Medicaments are diſſolved for many uſes; firſt,
<note place="margin">Diſſolutionis u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus multiplex.</note> that they may be eaſily aſſumed; ſecondly, that they may more readily be compounded with others; thirdly, that they may ſooner be diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted; fourthly, that they may penetrate into the part affected, and if need be, remain there; as when liquid Medicaments are injected into the belly, bladder, inteſtines, or any Ulcer in the body; fifthly, Medicaments are diſſolved that they may afterwards be ſtrained, and that their virtues purged from excrements, may ſooner enter the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward parts.</p>
                        <p>Thus Medicaments, which break the Stone,
<note place="margin">Dithontriptica.</note> are diſſolved ſometimes in white Wine, ſometimes in the juice of Limmons, in the water of Wall pelitory, Radiſh-roots, or ſuch like, that they may more eaſily permeate the holes of the reins, and the paſſages of the ureters. On the contrary, ſuch as are to be moved with the Spittle, are to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved in a thicker matter, as in Conſerves, or Sirrup,
<note place="margin">Anachartaſis quomodo mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vonda.</note> that they may appear rather as a Medicine to be ſucked, than drunk.</p>
                        <p>And as Triture, ſo alſo Infuſion, and oftentimes Calefaction are requiſite to Diſſolution; for ſuch as are hard, pliant, and viſcid, can ſcarce be diſſolved till they be broken, or ſteeped, or calefied by the Sun, or Fire.</p>
                        <p>Thus many Medicaments may be diſſolved preſently after Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:37350:69"/>and many kinds of Earth; others, not without long agitation, as all ſhels of Fiſhes, and many more. Some require both Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceration and Calfaction, as many Gummes, which before diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution ſhould be macerated with ſtrong Vinegar, <hi>Aqua vitae,</hi> or ſtrong Wine.</p>
                        <p>But Metals and Minerals cannot be diſſolved in any juice or liquor,
<note place="margin">Non quavis in quovis liquore dilui.</note> but in the juice of Limmons, in Vinegar diſtilled, or in ſuch Watert as the Alcumiſts call ſtrong Waters. Any Medicament therefore is not diſſolved in any liquor, but in ſome fit and determinate one; for Turpentine may lie a whole natural day in water, or in a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction, and ſcarce be diſſolved, without ſome Eggs yolks be ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>added.</p>
                        <p>In general, Greaſe, Marrow, and Fatneſs are melted at the fire, that they may be more eaſily diſſolved, and ingrede the compoſition of Unguents and Plaiſters. All kinds of odoriferous Medicaments are diſſolved in cordial Waters, or altering Waters, for moyſt me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicinal Plaiſters. Pils, or other Purges, whether compound or ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, are diſſolved in <hi>Aqua vitae,</hi> or other convenient Liquor, by an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial ſedulity in drawing out their extracts. Solid things alſo, which neither can nor ought to be exhibited in that form, are firſt to be broken and diſſolved in ſome convenient liquor, that they may more ſafely and eaſily be aſſumed.</p>

                        <p>But ſuch things as are concreted with diurnal cold, are very hard to melt, as Gold, Braſs, and Iron, the fuſion whereof rather pertains to ſuch as are exerciſed in Metals, and not in Medicaments, to an Artiſt, and not a Philoſopher.</p>
                        <p>Liquation differs from Diſſolution,
<note place="margin">Diſſolutio non niſi fit cum hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mere.</note> in that Liquation is alwayes cauſed by heat, and ſeldome or never with any humour; Diſſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion alwayes with humours, ſeldome with heat.</p>
                        <p>Lead is ſoon melted with heat; Sulphur, Pitch, and Roſin ſooner; Salt, Manna, Sugar, Gums of Ivy, Prunes, Juniper, and other Trees, are ſometimes worked in hot water, and ſo diffuſed, that they may be diſſolved.</p>

                        <p>Now the uſe of Liquation in Pharmacy is great, for it cauſes the Medicaments to change their form, and acquire a new one; and it alſo purges them, that their impure parts might be ſeparated from the pure and mundane.</p>

                        </head>
                        <p>MAny preparations of Medicaments hold ſuch affinity with others, that they are often taken for the ſame, as Liquation and Mollition, which onely differ according to their degree of more or leſs: ſo that Mollition is the beginning of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quation. For all things that are melted, firſt grow ſoft; and many things after mollition, if they be longer calefied, melt; yet not all; for Ivory, Claws and Horns may be mollified, but not melted.</p>
                        <p>Now Mollition happens two wayes;
<note place="margin">Mollitionem fieri duobus modis.</note> either by heat onely of the Fire, Sun, or Animal, or of ſome putrid matter, or by ſome affun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded humour, as when wax is mollified in hot water, or ſome harder medicamental maſs is ſteeped in ſome ſirrup, or convenient liquor, till it be mollified, and yield to the touch, which according to <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len,</hi> (<hi>cap. ult. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>de differ. pulſ.</hi>) is Judge of the hard or ſoft body.</p>
                        <p>Mother of Pearl, Shell-fiſhes, and Egge-ſhels macerated in diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Vinegar, are ſo mollified, that they may be wrought or drawn as you pleaſe. It is alſo thought, that Ivory may be mollified with Beer, or by being boyled for the ſpace of ſix hours with the root of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drakes.</p>
                        <p>Horns rarefied by the fire, or long boyled in water, or buried ſeven dayes in dung, do grow ſoft. It is thought the Coral in the juice of Barberies, Pearls in the juice of Limmons, and many Stones in certain Liquors, rightly prepared, will be ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
                        <p>Since according to <hi>Galen,</hi> (<hi>cap.</hi> 1. <hi>lib.</hi> 4. <hi>de dignoſ. pulſ.</hi>)
<note place="margin">Duratio.</note> thoſe things are hard to which our fleſh yields, and thoſe ſoft which yield to our fleſh; the doctrine of Mollition and Duration is as oppoſite in the ſame conſideration. Duration takes place in Pharmacy in compound Medicaments, which being preſerved
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:37350:70"/>for uſe, ought to be ſomewhat dryed and ſolid, as Electuaries, dry Conſerves, Salves, Pils, Trochisks, and ſome Sirrups.</p>
                        <p>Now Medicaments are hardned by cold,
<note place="margin">Quot modis medicament a indurentur.</note> heat, and the admixtion of dry things. By cold, as when ſuch things as are melted, or onely mollified, are removed from the fire, and being expoſed to the air, do refrigerate and harden. By heat, when Medicaments are boyled to their juſt conſiſtency, and their humid part abſumed; for ſo being dryer, they become obdurate. Medicaments alſo harden by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixtion of dry things, either that they may keep longer, or that in ſuch a conſiſtency they may be more eaſily and ſafely exhibited or applyed.</p>

                        <p>SUch Simples as are to be preſerved all Winter, or ſuch as are brought from forreign Countryes, ought to be accurately dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before they be repoſed in Cheſts, Boxes, or Bags; for their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cremental humidity coacted, and not dilated, ſoon corrupteth, and then their wholſome quality faileth.</p>
                        <p>Neither are Medicaments dryed onely for conſervation ſake,
<note place="margin">Quare medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menta ſiccentur</note> but often times that they may be pulverated, &amp; that their virtues may be more effectual. Now whatſoever is moyſt, and ſhould be dry, it muſt be dryed in the ſun or by the fire, or left in a very windy ſhade voyd of rain and duſt, till it be withered, and its ſuperfluous humidity al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together diſſipated.</p>
                        <p>Thoſe things are dryed to pulveration by the heat of the fire, which are burned in a furnace or oven, or on burning coals, as Bones, Claws, Horns, Shels; or in an earthen pot, as hairs of Animals, and ſuch things as are put in a fire pan, or covered in a diſh or platter ſet in or upon an oven where bread was lately extracted; for ſo Plums, Pears, Cherries, and ſuch humid Fruits are wont to be dryed.</p>
                        <p>Leaves and flowers,
<note place="margin">Quae in ſole melius ſiccentur</note> whoſe colour ſhould remain after drying, are beſt dryed by the Suns heat, eſpecially in Summer and Autumn. Seeds alſo gathered before perfect maturity, or in time of rain, or when the neceſſity of the matter requires it, cannot be exactly dryed, but in the Sun, or by the fire.</p>
                        <p>Thick and juicy roots alſo, unleſs they be cut ſmall, may be dryed better in a place expoſed to the Sun, and North-winde, than in a ſhade not agitated with the winde; and the deſiccation of many is to no purpoſe, unleſs inſolation have preceded.</p>
                        <p>Yet ſmall roots do eaſily dry in a ſhade, as alſo many great ones, if they be cut into little pieces, fixed on a thread, and expoſed to the ſhady air, ſo it be windy, not wet. Leaves do more eaſily dry,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:37350:70"/>which being bound in a bundle, are expoſed to the externall air, partly to the heat of the fire, being ſuſpended for the moſt part on the beames of ſhopps, flowers moſt eaſily; for being laid upon a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per or diſh, and moved, they are preſently dry.</p>
                        <p>Now leaves when dryed, are to be repoſed in baggs of Canvas, or paper, roots, flowers and ſeeds, in veſſells of glaſs or wood.</p>

The pills of Oranges, Limmons, and Pome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>granates, as alſo ſpungy roots, are dryed after the ſame manner in ſhops.</p>
                        <p>Foxes Lungs waſhed in wine may be dryed in an oven not very hot, Harts peezles in the open air, Wolves inteſtines in the ſhade, figgs, and grapes in the Sun, as alſo ſolid Confections, which after their conditure muſt be preſerved in ſugar, or ſyrrup.</p>

<pb n="80" facs="tcp:37350:72"/>vertue of the whole doth adhere as united to its ſubject, whence they call it an extract, as it were the eſſence extracted and ſeparated from the body.</p>
                        <p>For ſuch an Extract doth contain moſt excellent vertues in a ſmall quantity, a dragme whereof exhibited is of no leſſe efficacy than a whole ounce of any Medicament with its groſſe ſubſtance.</p>
                        <p>They are wont to give theſe extracts, to thoſe whoſe ventricles loathed Apothecaryes Medicines, and who had plenty of wealth: for to preſcribe the extract of Rhabarbe or Pearle to a poor man, were to take away his life.</p>
                        <p>Now theſe extracts of Medicaments as well ſimple as Compound,
<note place="margin">Extractum quomodo parandum.</note> are often made after this manner, the Medicament is waſhed, being firſt ſmall ſliced, or if it be a maſſe of Pills or an Electuary, it is diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the beſt <hi>Aqua vitae,</hi> or other fit liquor, ſo as it be covered two fingers, in a veſſell well and cloſe ſtopped, then it is left two or three dayes in a hot place, then they make a ſtrong expreſſion, which is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward put in <hi>Balneo Mariae,</hi> that the <hi>Aqua vitae</hi> may be ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the faculty of the Medicament, which lyes ſomewhat thick in a little quantity in the bottome of the veſſell, then it is gathered and repoſed in a glaſſe veſſell, or an earthen one well glaſſed, and ſo evaporated on hot embers.</p>
                        <p>If any one will make a more valid extract, then he macerates ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Medicament of the ſame kind, in the former expreſſion, and after a daily and perfect infuſion, he extracts it by compreſſion, as before, and this he doth three or foure times, if he deſire a more potent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, and at length the laſt expreſſion being finiſhed, he ſegregates the <hi>Aqua vitae</hi> from it by diſtillation in a hot bath, or he diſſipates it by inſolation, till the extract onely remain, which hath great and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full vertues in a ſmall body.</p>
                        <p>They do not caſt away Rhabarbe, and other Medicaments of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer value, after the firſt maceration or expreſſion as the vulgar do, but infuſe them twice thrice or four times in other <hi>Aqua vitae,</hi> till they have loſt their colour &amp; ſapour, and what ever vertue was in them be left in the waters, for then ought the laſt expreſſion to be made, which is mixed to the other, from all which the <hi>Aqua vitae</hi> is ſeparated by <hi>Balneo Mariae,</hi> and the ſubſident onely or extract left.</p>
                        <p>Theſe Extracts are not alwaies made by <hi>Aqua vitae,</hi> but oftentimes by the decoction of hearbs, ſtilled waters, and ſometimes by rain or fountain-waters,
<note place="margin">Extractum pilularum.</note> for ſome maſſes of pills are ſometimes macerated in rain-waters for the ſpace of eight dayes, the juice of Bugloſſe, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony, or other thing, as neceſſity requires, being added, then it is boyled on a ſlow fire, ſtrained and congealed.</p>
                        <p>After the ſame manner is one pound of the beſt Rhabarb, and of China ſliced ſmall, macerated by the ſpace of one whole day in two pounds of the juice of Borrage and Fumitory, well purified: then it is boyled on a ſlow fire,

                        <p>AS the husbandman with his fanne diſſipates the ſtraw and chaffe from his Wheat, ſo doth he with his ſieve ſegregate the beſt ſeed corn from the dead and feeble cornes, to whom Cribration rather appertains than to an Apothecary; yet both of them uſe this inſtrument to ſeparate the flower from the bran, which the vulgar call a ſearce, or ſieve, ſometimes a rangeing ſieve, and ſometimes a haire Tamiſe, which is made ſometimes of the haire of a horſes taile, ſometimes of flax, ſometimes of ſilk; now a ſieve is made of a vellume pervious with many round or long holes, through which tares and ſmall ſeeds may eaſily deſcend, the more ſucculent and good remaining: Cribration therefore is of uſe for that prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Medicaments, which is performed in a ſieve.</p>
                        <p>The uſe of this preparation is much,
<note place="margin">Cribrationis uſus.</note> for hereby the flower of grounded ſeeds, or the meale is ſeparated from the branne: boyled roots are cleanſed from their barks, and fruits purged from their grains and ſtones.</p>
                        <p>The Quinteſſence of <hi>Caſſia fiſtula</hi> is put in a ſieve made of horſes haire, that the pith alone thus purged from the broken huskes and ſeeds may be extracted, which is called extract of <hi>Caſſia.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Tamarinds and Dates macerated in vineger or other liquor, are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſame manner put into a hairy ſieve for many definite uſes, and ſo pulped through with a <hi>Manipulus:</hi> many ſeeds are boyled till they crackle, as roots and leaves, till they be very ſoft, and then are tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted through a ſieve made of haire, to the confection of Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaſmes and other Medicines of divers forms.</p>
                        <p>Cordiall powders, as alſo others which are ingredients in a Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camentall compoſition, muſt be ſierced in a ſmall tamiſe or fine ſieve, and eſpecially ſuch as are adminiſtred to looſe obſtructions, and move urine, or monthly flowers; for by how much ſuch are finer, by ſo much the ſooner are they carried to the places affected.</p>
                        <p>In ſifting ſome powders, a hairy tamiſe is requiſite, in others a ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken one, or one of pure and rare linnen.</p>
                        <p>Cribration is chiefly for the more commodious mixtion of things
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:37350:73"/>pulverated, or of ſmall bigneſſe, and the ſeparation of the ſmaller portion, which is often better, from the groſſer portion, which is often worſe.</p>
                        <p>Now as there are ſeverall inſtruments that ſerve for Cribration,
<note place="margin">Varius cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brandi modus.</note> ſo is the manner of Cribration diverſe; for properly Corn and Pulſe are to be put in a ſieve, ſtirred with a hand, and turning the ſeeds this way and that way in the ſieve holden up, which ablegates the bad ſeed, and retains the good.</p>
                        <p>After the ſame manner Cordiall powders are ſifted,
<note place="margin">Pulveres car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diaci quomodo cribrandi.</note> the tamiſe being moved to and fro in a mans hands, not violently ſhaken, that the ſmaller part of the powder may be tranſmitted, the thicker part left.</p>
                        <p>Some, that they may be more eaſily tranſmitted, ought in the rang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſieve to be ſhaken into a round, or other ſolid body with many percuſſions, leaſt the groſſer parts be faſtned in the ſieve, and therefore almoſt all ought to be grinded before they be ſift in the Tamiſe, and thoſe that will ſcarce permeale the tamiſe or ſieve, for craſſitude, ought again to be grinded, and beaten till they may all paſſe through for tenuity and fineneſs.</p>

                        <p>UPon what account dry Medicaments are ſifted, upon the ſame are moiſt ones ſtrained, for that the filth may be ſegregated, and the pure and ſincere liquor onely extracted, it is tranſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted through a ſtrainer, and that either thick or rare, or of a mean tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as the commodious uſe of the thing and exigency requires, therefore the practiſers of Pharmacy hold it requiſite to keep many ſtrainers in their ſhops, both thick and rare linnen, wollen, hempen, or hairy, often old, but oftner new, that in a ſtrong compreſſion, all the juice of the thing ſtrained may be tranſmitted without the rupture of the cloth.</p>
                        <p>That groſſe and viſcid matters may be rightly ſtrained,
<note place="margin">Ad craſſorum &amp; viſcidorum colaturam quid requiratur.</note> three things are required, that they be waſhed in more abundance of humour, that they be put in a more rare and new ſtrainer, and that they be longer calified before colation, for ſo their denſity being more rarified, they may more eaſily permeate; thus the juices of fleſh and hearbs are to be calified before they be ſtrained, and all kinds of Honey and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na eaten out of any liquor. That that which is extraneous and ſordid, if any ſuch thing be mixed with it, may be ſeparated by Cola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                        <p>Thoſe that are thin as the juice of hearbs, Lemmons and many fruits ought to be ſtrained warme, and often cold, for ſo their terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriall and groſſer part remaines, the purer and more ſincere being
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:37350:73"/>transferred, as it were fined from their dreggs. But Milk and muddy waters are ſtrained cold, that haires, if any be fallen thereinto, may be ſeparated from the one, and mud from the other, yet all that which makes the water muddy is oft ſeparated from it by reſidence, as we ſee in Ciſternes, where water ſtands: Tent-wine alſo is three or more times ſtrained cold in a linnen napkin very long and fine, for procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the more pleaſant mixture and conſiſtency of the Sugar, wine, and ſweet ſpices, wherewith it is compounded.</p>
                        <p>Some may not be ſtrained unleſſe very hot, others cold, others warme, and many need onely one colation, ſome two, and ſome three, till they grow cleer.</p>
                        <p>Apozemes are ſtrained through common ſtrainers, ſometimes through a woollen bag, or linnen ſtrainer, but ſyrrups which are more groſs, becauſe of the admixtion of honey, ſugar, and their long coction, cannot ſo eaſily tranſmeate, and therefore require a thin lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen ſtrainer.</p>
                        <p>Decoctions, whereof unguents are made, are ſtrained after the, ſame manner, as alſo the unguents themſelves liquified, till ſome thick thing, which hath eſcaped the ſtroke of the Peſtell, and the heat of the fire, be ſegregated.</p>
                        <p>The thinner part of many Medicaments is ſegregated from the thic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, by the other kind of colation called filtration,
<note place="margin">Filtratio.</note> which apparation thoſe Medicaments onely uſe, which make up the compound called Virgins Milk, or which expoſtulate onely ſome ſmaller and thinner ſubſtance of ſome Medicament; for they aſſume linnen or woollen liſts two or three fingers broad, and very long, and they dip the one end in the veſſell wherein the Medicament to be ſtrained is contained, the other end reacheth to another veſſell that ſtands below it, and bending into it, doth caſt out by drop and drop that humour into it, which it had continently drawn from the former veſſell.</p>

<note place="margin">Spumae effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entes cnaſae.</note> and nothing that is crude, and not moved is covered with ſcum, then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpumation appertaines to ſuch things as by agitation and coction ingender ſcum.</p>
                        <p>That Honey and Sugar may be cleanſed from ſcum, an equall and ſometimes a double portion of liquor is put to them, and in boyling the ſcum is taken off with a blunt ſpoon, leaſt together with the ſcum, the liquor, in which the concoction is made, ſhould be taken off; but if deſpumation by this rule ſeem unperfect, then adde to certain pound weights of liquor certain whites of eggs; which aſſoone as they are hardened by continuall boyling; they gather ſcum, ſo that the ſegregation of it from the liquour will be very eaſy, becauſe in ſtraining it will be left in the ſtrainer together with the whites of the eggs, the ſincere and pure liquour onely tranſmitted. If the honey be very impure, it muſt be boyled in a treble portion of liquor till it come to half, that the deſpumation may be perfect, which rule will hold in ſcumming other very impure Medicaments.</p>
                        <p>Honey may be purged and cleanſed from ſcum by it ſelf,

                        <p>Sugar to be purged of ſcum ought ſo long to be boyled, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter deſpumation, that which was a pound before, may remain no more than a pound, though two or three ounces of liquor have been added to the coction.</p>
                        <p>Fruits that are to be preſerved while they are boyled with ſugar, or as ſome do better boyle them in a portion of ſugar, are purged by ſome few ſcum onely with a ſpoon, as things full cocted are with a linnen ſtrainer, for they are wont to be tranſmitted through a cloth extended, and faſtned with nailes at every corner, that the ſcum and dreggs might be left above.</p>

                        <p>CLarification is a purging of liquid Medicaments from their groſſer matter, for hereby they are more acceptable to the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, and may more eaſily be diſtributed.

<pb n="85" facs="tcp:37350:74"/>third part, and then ſtand two dayes till they grow cleere,
<note place="margin">Clarificatio quot modis fiat.</note> whence clarification is effected five manner of ways, by reſt, by colation, by deſpumation, by the mixtion of vinegar, or ſome ſharp matter, and by the agitation and coction of whites of Eggs with the thing to be clarified. For if decoctions and ſyrups partake of vinegar, they will be more and more purged by themſelves through the vertue of the vinegar. And whites of eggs muſt be agitated with a ſpoon, till they be all froathy, then put to the ſyrups or decoctions, which muſt be boyled again: and when the ſcum is gathered about the whites of eggs by perfect coction, then muſt the ſcum be artifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally craded and ſeparated, either by common trajection, which is through a four cornered cloath faſtned at every corner with a nail, or by a more peculiar colation which is through <hi>Hyppocrates</hi> his ſleeve. Colation ſhould be iterated three or four times, till the ſyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rup or decoction be plainly cleere.</p>
                        <p>Men of later times have made certain potions in the form of a Julep, which with their conſiſtency being very clear, they call them Clarers, but ſuch are made after the manners before nominated.</p>

Yet Medicaments ſometimes need theſe; for Saliture conduces much to conſervation, Farture to good ſapour, and Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to both. For Flowers and Fruits are not condited onely, but alſo little ſtalks, barks, and tender roots, both that they may be lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger preſerved, and alſo eat more pleaſantly. Thus are the roots of tender Ginger, and husks of <hi>Caſſia Fiſtula,</hi> which are not old. Nut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>megs, Myrobolans, and other forreign Fruits, are condited while freſh, that they may be brought to us without any loſs of their vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and faculties, from far Countreys. Many of our own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, ſweet, ſour, or Fruits of other ſapours, pleaſant to the palate, as ſoon as they are gathered, and if need be, their Cortes pill'd off, (for many are not decorticated, as Gooſeberries, Barberries) and ſo are boyled with Sugar, or Honey, or both. Thoſe that are bitter, very ſour, and ſharp, are ſo long macerated in water, till they have depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed their vehement quality.</p>
                        <p>Now Apothecaries do eſpecially make humid Conditures, as they call them; as when they ſo long concoct Fruits or Roots with Sugar and Water, that they loſe all their watry humidity, and after Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Reconditure may be preſerved with a Sirrup perfectly boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</p>
                        <p>But Confectioners do not onely make ſuch like Conditures as theſe, but alſo dry ones, as they term them, which are made of Fruits ſugared, with Sugar extrinſecally boyled with them, and afterwards dryed by inſolation. Now many Fruits are condited with Salt alone, as Capers; or with ſome Vinegar added to them,
<note place="margin">Salitura.</note> as Cucumbers cut in pieces, Purſlain, Lettices, and many Pot-herbs, that they may
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:37350:76"/>without decay be preſerved till Winter; for Salt hath an admirable faculty in deſiccating and conſerving things. Hence Fleſh and Fiſh ſalted are kept without corruption, not onely ſome months, but years. Wherefore by ſome Philoſophers,
<note place="margin">Epicureis ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma pro ſale.</note> the Soul is called the Salt of the Body, becauſe as long as it remains therein, it vindicates and defends it from putrefaction. It cauſes alſo, that Medicaments acquire ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther quality beſide what is peculiar to them; and therefore Vipers fleſh, and the parts of many Animals, are beſprinkled with white and bay Salt, (for according to <hi>Galen,</hi> there is the ſame faculty in both) with a little, if it be uſed for ſapours ſake; with more, if for condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſake.</p>

An old Cock is wont to be ſtuffed with Barley, that beſides its faculty of ſubducing the belly, wherein according to <hi>Galen</hi> and <hi>Oribaſius,</hi> it is effectual, it may cleanſe and nouriſh. Night-caps are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten quilted with Cephalical Powders put in a double linnen cloth: the topical remedy of the form of a Buckler is prepared after the ſame manner, but it receives roborating and ſtomachical Pouders, ſuch as are wont to be preſcribed to the weakneſs of the belly. But it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly called Farture, by which exenterated Animals, and excavated Fruits are ſtuffed with medicamental or alimental things, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with aromatical, onely for jucundity ſake.</p>

                        </head>
                        <p>DIſtillation is an education of a watry or oily humour out of any thing by heat.
<note place="margin">Distillatio quid</note> And it is effected either by aſcenſion, or deſcenſion, and that either by a humid or a dry heat. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtillations by humid heat are made in <hi>Balneum Mariae,</hi> or in a Vapour made of hot water.
<note place="margin">Balneum Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riae.</note> 
                           <hi>Balneum Mariae, aut maris,</hi> as ſome ſay, is a Veſſel containing in it heat, into which another veſſel is put, containing the matter to be diſtilled. It was wont to be called <hi>Cucurbita,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Cucurbita.</note> or <hi>Boccia,</hi> upon which is put another Veſſel with a beak, commonly called an Alembick or Capitel, which are moſt ſtrictly cloſed together with a glew made of Bran, and whites of Eggs.</p>
                        <p>Diſtillation in the vapour of hot water is alſo made in two veſſels;
<note place="margin">Balneum roris.</note> the one contains the matter to be diſtilled, and in the other is put a
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:37350:76"/>long copper or braſs veſſel half full of water; ſo that there is ſpace enough left between the <hi>Cucurbita</hi> and the boyling water, by the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour of which carried upwards, the matter to be diſtilled grows hot, and ſuſcitates the vapours to the beaked Capitel, whence it deſcends into the Receiver.</p>
                        <p>Both theſe Bathes are deſcribed in various forms; for every one,
<note place="margin">Variae ſunt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mae balnei.</note> according to his minde, changes, innovates, adds or detracts ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing rather form the elegancy of the <hi>Boccia,</hi> than the facility of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtillation. But in all of them, the fire, which is the efficient cauſe of Diſtillation, muſt be made in ſuch place, that with little labour it may calefie the water in the <hi>Boccia.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now the fire ſhould be clear, not ſmoky or filthy,
<note place="margin">Ignis in distil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latione qualis.</note> ſuch as is made of Charcoal or Cannel; and it muſt be ſo ordered, that it neither be too potent, and burn the matter, nor ſo ſmall as to be extinguiſhed before the work be perfected. Before the water begin to be cold, let other be made hot, or at leaſt warm, and calefied according to that degree of heat which the condition of the matter requires; for ſome may be diſtilled with a benign vapour, others with a more potent, others beſt with warm water.</p>
                        <p>Integral freſh Plants, or parts of them cut into pieces,
<note place="margin">Plantarum di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtillatio.</note> are conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently diſtilled in a humid Bath. If they be dry, they ſhould be wet with ſome convenient liquor before Diſtillation; for ſo the waters diſtilled do better retain the ſtrength and faculties of the Plants, though they cannot be ſo preſerved, becauſe more excrementitious. Yet many waters do not retain the ſapours of the Plants, becauſe they ſo inhere in their terreſtrial ſubſtance, that they will not aſcend with the moſt vehement heat.</p>
                        <p>The humid Bath is expedient in diſtilling waters; the dry one (if it may be called a Bath, as it pleaſes moſt) in educing oils and waters,
<note place="margin">Balneum ſic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum.</note> Now it is properly called dry, becauſe no water is put under the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curbita, but fire onely, with duſt, ſand, or the filings of iron or ſteel ſometimes interpoſed. Which that it may be commodiouſly done,
<note place="margin">Fornacis ſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctura.</note> the furnace muſt be built with ſuch induſtry, that it may have a port open towards the bottome, through which the aſhes may be taken out which fall from the burning coals laid upon the little gridiron. Above the gridiron there muſt be another port, through which the coals may be immitted; above the arch whereof muſt be inſerted little iron beams or grates overthwart: then above muſt be placed the brazen, earthen, or iron pan, into which the Cucurbita is put, and it muſt be buried, ſand or aſhes being caſt upon it, then the bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Capitel may be placed above it. In the top of the furnace muſt be conſtituted certain holes, or wind-paſſages, through which the ſmoke may paſs.</p>
                        <p>The uſe of a certain Inſtrument of Copper, called an Alembick,
<note place="margin">Alembicus.</note> is here requiſite and frequent; in whoſe inferiour cavity are contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned iron beams, ſuſtaining the burning coals; in its middle, the <hi>Boc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia;</hi> in its ſuperiour part, the beaked Capitel, in form of a Helmet;

                        <p>The beak in ſome Alembicks is very long and ſtrait, and oft times in ſome of the form of a ſerpent; whence it is called a twining beak, or worm, that ſo it may be transferred through a Hogſhead full of cold water, whereby the water may be better congealed and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered.</p>
                        <p>A certain <hi>Boccia</hi> made of glaſs,
<note place="margin">Retorta veſica.</note> and crooked, commonly called a Retort, ſerves for that diſtillation which is made by ſand or aſhes; as alſo another ſtrait one, which hath its name from a bladder, of oval form, made of glaſs or copper lined with tin, which ſerves for diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling thoſe things which are eaſily ſublevated, as roots, ſeeds, leaves, flowers, and ſuaveolent Spices; ſuch as are not ſo eaſily ſublevated, as farneſſes, roſins and gums are to be extolled, and that more aptly in a Retort of very thick glaſs.</p>
                        <p>The forms of diſtilling are ſo many,
<note place="margin">Varia diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landi formeae.</note> and the inſtruments, as alſo their matter ſo various, that they can ſcarce be kept within certain Laws: yet is this old cuſtome ſtill obſerved, that Apothecaries do commonly diſtill young Plants, and other Medicaments in Pewter Alembicks, or Leaden, tinn'd within, which are not ſo noxious as many fear: yet them of Glaſs and Clay are better, but they may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily be broken, and then uſeleſs. Now ſuch things as may not endure the vehemency of heat, may be better diſtilled in <hi>Balneum Maria,</hi> afterwards in hot aſhes, wherein, as in the Bath, ſome temperate and milde heat may be preſerved and cheriſhed; not ſo in ſand and filing duſt, for theſe will not be hot but with vehement heat; wherefore they are uſed in educing Oils by diſtillation.

                        </head>
                        <p>DIſtillation is made both by moyſt and dry calour, as well by aſcent a deſcent. By aſcent, when by the force of the heat of fire, water, or other body interpoſed, the thinner part of the matter in the Cucurbita is elevated to the Capitel, where condenſed,
<note place="margin">Varii diſtilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionis per de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcenſum modi.</note> by its weight it declines to the beak, and runs into a veſſel ſet under the beak. And as the diſtillations by aſcent are multifarious, ſo alſo them by deſcent; for one diſtillation is properly
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:37350:78"/>ſaid to be by deſcent, to wit, when the humour educed without exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation diſtils downwards; another is by inclination, another by tranſudation, another by filtration.</p>
                        <p>That cannot properly be called Diſtillation, nor referred to this place, which is made without heat, as by Expreſſion, or Colation.</p>
                        <p>Diſtillation by deſcent is ſometimes made without heat,
<note place="margin">Diſtillationem fiert interdum ſine calore.</note> as when a bag filled with Myrrhe or Tartar, is ſuſpended in vapouriſh air, or in a Wine cellar; for theſe, as many more, long kept in a moyſt place, become tabid, and as it were exude a pure juice, which they emit into a veſſel ſet under them.
<note place="margin">Quomodo aqua educatur per deſcenſum.</note> But it is made more frequently by fire, by whoſe power not onely waters, but alſo oils are educed by deſcent. Thus the water of Roſes, and other Flowers, may be well diſtiled. A pot of copper, braſs, or clay, is taken and filled with Roſes, or other Flowers, cloſe covered with a head, and a veſſel full of coals is ſet under the body containing the Flowers, out of which when they are calefied, very good water will exude into the glaſs ſubjected. But the fire is to be ſo ordered, that the Flowers may not be burned, and therefore many prudently put paper betwixt the veſſel containing the fire, and the Flowers; for hereby they may better endure the heat. But this manner of diſtilling, as it is eaſy, ſo is it common.</p>
                        <p>Some diſtill waters in dung, or other putrid matter:
<note place="margin">Diſtillatio in fimo.</note> but the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecary may eaſily want theſe modes, who ſhould be neat, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the moſt ſelect remedies.
<note place="margin">Distillatio in calore ſolis.</note> That diſtillation which is made in the heat of the Sun after this manner, is more commendable. A pot filled with Roſes, or other Flowers, is firmly joyned to another pot ſet under it; then it is expoſed to the Sun; for if its beams beat upon the upper pot, very good water will diſtill into the lower.</p>
                        <p>But the diſtillation of Oils by deſcent is more difficult,
<note place="margin">Oleorum diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latio per de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtenſum.</note> and can ſcarce be effected without great preparation, labour, and time: yet is it very familiar to the Alcumiſts who educe Oils by deſcent after many manners; for they ſo prepare the veſſels and inſtruments for diſtillation, that they give no paſſage by aſcent, but the humour as it were melted and educed, exudes downwards by drops. Thoſe Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters or Oils may be thus diſtilled, which the aſcending vapours would deſtroy, or the potent ſpirits diſſipate, before they were brought to a conſiſtency.</p>
                        <p>There are ſeveral modes of this diſtillation;
<note place="margin">Diſtillatio per tranſudationem</note> one is in a furnace by tranſudation, whereby the humour provoked doth tranſude, and falls by drops into the ſubjected veſſel, fire being placed above it. Another is made by tranſudation, but it is in the earth, when a ditch is diffoded in the earth, into which is put a pot, to whoſe orifice is fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and joyned the bottome of another pot full of little holes, and the orifice of the upper pot is covered cloſe, in which pot is contained the matter to be diſtilled; then the earth being adhibited, both pots are interred even to the belly of the upper pot, ſo that the conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is covered: then the fire is put to by degrees, according to the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:37350:79"/>nature and condition of the matter to be diſtilled; for a more ſolid matter requires greater heat, leſs ſolid a leſſer.</p>
                        <p>There is another diſtillation,
<note place="margin">Distillatio per inclinationem.</note> which is a mean betwixt the diſtilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by aſcent, and that by deſcent, which is by inclination, in which there is a little elevation, and afterwards a reflexion downwards. It is alſo called a diſtillation by retortion, becauſe it is made in a bend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Boccia,</hi> in whoſe curvature the ſpirits united are compelled to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend into the receptacle placed below, and well joyned to the croo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked beak. Now this retorted <hi>Boccia</hi> ſhould lye in a furnace built ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, the belly whereof muſt be buried in a pot wherein are aſhes or ſand, and the beak muſt hang out through ſome hole or chink.</p>
                        <p>The retorted <hi>Boccia</hi> is wont to be uſed in diſtilling ſuch things as aſcend with difficulty,
<note place="margin">Quand re or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tae in diſtilitatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus uſurpan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dae.</note> as in the educing Oils out of Metals, and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits out of Minerals, to which moſt vehement heat is required, and therefore heed muſt be taken leſt the Retorts be burſt; therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they be ſet upon the fire, they ought to be incruſted with clay, marl, or ſuch convenient matter, if nitrous matters be contained in them; and they muſt immediately with aſhes or ſand be adhibited to the moſt violent fire. But becauſe we purpoſe not to relate Chymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Diſtillations, nor their Matrals, nor deſcribe their Cucurbites, Handles, Veſſels, crooked, round or long, their Diſhes, Pots, and Furnaces, we will no further proſecute their precepts in diſtillation, for they may be ſooner and eaſier learned with practice and exerciſe, than by deſcription.</p>
                        <p>Alcumiſts preſcribe not onely many Diſtillations, but alſo o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther preparations, as Sublimation, Cohobation, Exhalation, Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration, Exaltation, and many more, wherewith their Books are ſtuffed.
<note place="margin">Sublimatio. Cohobatio. Caput mortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um.</note> Sublimation is when the Extract attains to the ſublime part of the Veſſel, and ſubſiſts there. Cobobation is when that which is educed, is put again to the dead Head; now the dead Head as it is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by them, is as it were dregs without juice, or excrements voyd of any quality: yet ſometimes this is the matter of the Chymical Salt. Exhalation is a diſſipation of dry ſpirits in the air by heat.
<note place="margin">Exhalatio. Evaporatio. Exaltatio.</note> Evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is a reſolution of moyſt ſpirits. Exaltation doth not deſign the ſame thing that Sublimation doth, for it is an artificial preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whereby the matter is after ſome manner changed and brought to a higher dignity of ſubſtance and virtue; as when ſome rude and crude matter is brought to maturity and perfection.
<note place="margin">Maturatio.</note> Maturation and Gradation they ſay conduce to this, as Digeſtion, and ſometimes Circulation do to Maturation.
<note place="margin">Digeſtio.</note> Maturation is an exaltation from a rude crudity to a well cocted and elaborate perfection. Digeſtion is a ſimple Maturation, whereby things incocted and untractable, are cocted and made more milde and tractable by a digeſtative heat. Circulation is an exaltation of pure Liquor by a circular ſolution,
<note place="margin">Circulatio. Gradatio.</note> by the help of the heat in <hi>Mercuries</hi> or <hi>Pelicans</hi> Cup. Gradation
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:37350:79"/>appertains properly to Metals, for it is an exaltation of them to a greater degree of bonity and perfection, whereby their weight, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and conſiſtency is brought to a more excellent degree. But that I may no longer digreſs from my purpoſe, I will leave their Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical Preparations to themſelves; for this Treatiſe of Diſtillation compelled me briefly to touch of theſe, and paint it on the margin as a Work by the by.</p>

                        <p>SEeing the virtue of Flowers may be eaſily diſſipated, it can ſcarce be long retained integral, but is much impaired with coction and time, and often reſolved. Now that it may be retained, Flowers are wont to be condited in Sugar or Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and a Compound is made, that may be preſerved for many months and years, without any great impairing of virtue; whence it is properly called a Conſerve; whereof we have two different kinds,
<note place="margin">Conſervarum differentia.</note> the one is liquid and ſoft, which will yield to the preſſure of ones finger, wherein is left ſome lentor; the other dry, which is much more ſolid, and made into Paſtils or Trochisks, to which our fingers rather yield.</p>
                        <p>But becauſe all Flowers have not a like compact ſubſtance, or like temper, they are not all condited after the ſame manner, nor require the ſame quantity of Sugar in their conditure.</p>
                        <pb n="105" facs="tcp:37350:84"/>
                        <p>Thoſe that are more humid ſhould taleby a day or two in a place neither too humid, nor too hot, that their ſuperfluous humidity may be reſolved. Thoſe that are dryer, by how much they are more freſh and ſucculent, by ſo much the better.</p>
                        <p>Amongſt the more humid, whereof Conſerves are made, we rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon the Flowers of Water-lillies, Roſes, Succory, Violets, Borage, and Bugloſs; amongſt the dryer Flowers, of Sage, Hyſſop, Roſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary, Oranges, Jaſmine, Betony, Peach-trees, and many other Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, which are ſeldome or never condited.</p>
                        <p>The more humid require a greater quantity of Sugar to their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, the dryer a leſs; to ſome an equal weight of Sugar is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, to other half their weight, to many twice their weight, to Roſes and Water-lillies thrice their weight is requiſite.</p>
                        <p>Some are integrally mixed with twice their weight, or a ſufficient quantity of Sugar, and are ſet to be inſolated one or two months, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the craſſitude or tenuity of the Flowers.</p>
                        <p>Others, as Roſes, after their purgation from the white,
<note place="margin">Conſerva roſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum qui fiat.</note> whereby they are faſtned to the bud, and their triture in a ſtone morter with a peſtel of Box wood, are mixed exquiſitely with thrice their weight of Sugar, and then repoſed in an earthen pot well leaded, and are well covered with a paper not forated, leſt the virtue of the Flowers ſhould be diſſipated.</p>
                        <p>This done, the veſſel is inſolated by the ſpace of a whole month, or forty dayes, for hereby the Conditure is excellently fermentated, the heat of the Sun permeating every part thereof, if it be ſtirred twice or thrice a week with a <hi>Spatula,</hi> which is effected without any diſſipation of its virtues or odour.</p>
                        <p>Some immerge and perfectly mix integral Flowers, ſometimes and oft braying in Sugar melted and cocted to the conſiſtency of an Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary, which when it is cold, they put in boxes, and inſolate it.</p>
                        <p>If in the conditing, a little juice of Lemmon be injected,
<note place="margin">Quomodo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerva rubra fiat.</note> it will attain a red and lively colour, that it will not loſe in a years ſpace, if it be repoſed in a Veſſel while it is hot; for afterwards refrigerating, a certain ſcum or cruſt ariſes upon the ſuperficies, which preſerves the colour, odour, and virtue longer.</p>
                        <p>Conſerves are ſeldome made of leaves, becauſe their ſubſtance is more compact, and quality leſs diffipable; for they may be brought from far Countreys, without impairing their virtues. Yet ſome, which have excellent faculties poſited in their ſuperficies, cannot be dryed without damage, as Sorrel, and <hi>Capillus veneris.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Conſerves may well be made of them well purged, as of Monſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelian, Maidens hair, which is accounted the beſt, as many other Simples abundant in that Countrey. Yet have I heard the City <hi>Monſpelier</hi> more commended for Medicks than Medicaments.</p>
                        <p>However, excellent Conſerves of Maidens-hair is carried from <hi>Monſpelier</hi> to all the Countreys in <hi>France,</hi> which is made of an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual quantity of pulverated Sugar, and cleanſed Leaves brayed and
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:37350:85"/>mixed together, after inſolated ſo long as is convenient.</p>
                        <p>Some hold this Conſerve to be better, if a Syrup perfectly cocted be made of the decoction of this herb and Sugar, and then mixed to other cleanſed and brayed Leaves of this herb, for thus it acquires a more excellent virtue, and a more fit conſiſtency.</p>
                        <p>Dry Conſerve is made of dry Roſes levigated very ſmall with eight times their quantity of Sugar boyled in Roſe-water to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency of an Electuary,
<note place="margin">Conſervae ex roſis ſiccis.</note> to which a little juice of ſome ſowr Simple, as Lemmons or Sorrel, may be mixed; for this juice doth not onely make it ſweet, and ſowr, and pleaſant to the taſte, but of a more red and pleaſant colour.</p>
                        <p>By the ſame art may other dry Conſerves be made of dry Flowers.</p>

                        <p>And ſuch things as are to be condited, are firſt concocted in an apt ſyrup, and repoſed and reſerved with it in an earthen glaſs or veſſel, which are called by Apothecaries,
<note place="margin">Condita liqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da.</note> liquid Condites. But if after per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Concoction they be expoſed to the open air till their ſuperficies be dry, and that viſcid lentor, wherewith they cleaved to the fingers of ſuch as touch them,

For examples ſake; if Seeds are to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited, the Sugar muſt firſt be cocted into the conſiſtency of a ſyrup, then is it by little and little poured upon the Seeds; then are they
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:37350:85"/>moved with ones hand, and that ſo long, till the Seeds be covered and incruſtated all over with the Sugar. Lemmons pils ſmall cut, as alſo Cynamon, are condited after the ſame manner. Now Fruits being humid, they require a liquid Confecture, and Seeds being dry, a dry one.</p>

                        <p>THE Medicinal Art can by no means want Powders; for when Medicaments are either too humid, or dry, by the Greeks called <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>; the dry for the moſt part are pulverated, the humid are made up and concinnated with theſe Powders, as Electuaries, ſolid Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, Trochisks, Plaiſters, and other Medicaments, both intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecally to be aſſumed, and extrinſecally to be applyed; for nothing in Chirurgery is more frequently preſcribed than incarnating, aſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, and cloſing Powders;
<note place="margin">Pulverum in Chirurgia fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quens uſus.</note> and nothing ſo carefully prepared and kept of Apothecaries as cordial, capital, and roborating Powders, which are not onely mixed with other forms of Medicaments, but oftentimes preſcribed alone to divers uſes and affections, as to robo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the principal parts, preſerve their ſtrengths, extinguiſh Poyſons, ſtay Fluxes, help concoction, to binde or loſe the belly.</p>
                        <p>Many external paſſions are oft cured with theſe alone,
<note place="margin">Pulvis vulne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarius optimus.</note> ſeldome without them, as any Wound with red Powder compounded of two parts of Dragons-blood, and one of Frankincenſe, as a great Ulcer after deterſion with incarnating Powder.
<note place="margin">Pulvis epuloti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus optimus.</note> Thus a ſlaſh or skar of a Wound is cloſed with an Epulotical Powder, the beſt whereof are the Powders of <hi>Pompholix,</hi> Braſs oar, Ceruſe, <hi>Spodium, Terra Lem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> and Lead, rightly prepared.</p>
                        <p>Now generally,
<note place="margin">Pulveres in medicina quid praeſtent.</note> Medicaments are either given in the form of Powders, or of them other forms are made, borrowing their matter from Powders; for theſe do not onely ſerve for to be fitted to the forms of ſeveral Medicaments, but whether you look to the body, or the quality of Medicaments, theſe are for the moſt part their very Baſis.</p>
                        <p>And Powders are made of the moſt ſelect Medicaments beaten more or leſs, as the nature of the Medicament, or the exigency of the matter requires. And all that are levigated or redacted into Powder, are called of the Latines by a general name, <hi>Pulveres;</hi> which the Arabians call diſtinctly by theſe three idioms, <hi>Sufful, Alkool,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Alkool, Sufful, Sief.</note> and <hi>Sief.

                        <pb n="108" facs="tcp:37350:86"/>
                        <p>Now ſome Powders, to wit, ſuch as are made by the Confectioners, are deſtinated onely to Sauces, as the Powders of Pepper, Ginger, Nutmeg, Cynamon, and ſuch like ſweet Spices; and they are called of the Seplaſiaries, ſmall Spices, which they uſed to keep in Leather bags. Other Powders are cordial, and roborative, which pertain onely to the Medicinal Art, as the Powder of <hi>Diarrhodon Abbatis, Diacynamon, Dianiſi, Laetitia Galeni,</hi> and other cordial Powders, which ſhould be repoſed in boxes, glaſſes, or pots cloſe covered, leſt their virtue ſuddenly expire. Other Powders are alſo made, as Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thartick Powders, which are onely for preſent, not future uſes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe by keeping they are much worſe and weaker.</p>
                        <p>Yet ſcarce is any Powder internally aſſumed alone, and unmixed, but is put in water, or ſome other liquor, though not ſo applyed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally, which we often lay to Wounds and Ulcers alone.</p>
                        <p>Perfumers,
<note place="margin">Coſmeticorum studium.</note> Chamberers, and ſuch as would take away wrinkles from old women with painting, and promiſe to faſcinate and cure ſtinking breaths, make ſeveral Powders of ſuaveolent Spices, as of the root of Orris, of Roſes, Sandals, Storax, <hi>Betzoini,</hi> ſweet Cane, Cynamon, Cloves, Marjorum, Amber, Musk, Civet; of which, and other odoriferous Simples, they make two excellent Powders, which they call <hi>Chyprium &amp; Violetum;</hi> and alſo many other and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Powders for the delectation of them that deſire them. They are wont to repoſe them in ſilken bags, and put them in cheſts with their cloaths.

                        <p>But if according to <hi>Galen,</hi> the difference of Antidotes, or Electua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries be taken from their quality and vertues, ſome are aſſumed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of deadly Medicaments, others are prevalent againſt venemous beaſts, others are preſcribed to diſeaſes contracted by ill victualls, and ſome are accommodated to all theſe uſes, which may not only be wholſomley introſumed, but alſo, externally applyed, as Triacle Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thridate.</p>
                        <p>Electuaries according to their different ſolidity, are called Dry and Tabulated,
<note place="margin">Electuaria ſic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca ac tabulata.</note> or Liquid, which have the conſiſtency of an opiate, a mean betwixt an Eclegme and Pills, as all Antidotes, whoſe powders are ſubactd with ſape, honey, or wine, which put to ſugar righly prepared, and agitated with a woodden peſtell do acquire the juſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency of a ſolid Electuary: So that wine, and the ſame Electuary may be formed liquid or ſolid according to the adjection of ſugar or honey with artificiall mixtion, yet they can ſcarce be brought to a ſolid Conſiſtency which admit of the extract of <hi>Caſsia,</hi> and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner part of fruits.</p>
                        <p>The proportion of honey to powders in liquid Electuaries ſhould be the ſame with ſugar to them in dry and ſolid Electuaries, which is that to one pound of honey or ſugar ſhould be mixed three ounces of Powder, yet either may be increaſed or diminiſhed, as the power of the Antidote is requiſite to be more valid or more weak, for by how much more ſugar or honey is added to the powders, by ſo much is the Electuary weaker, and by how much the leſſe, by ſo much the ſtronger.</p>
                        <p>In purging Lozenges, one dramme of powder ſhould be mixed with an ounce of ſugar cocted in water, or ſome juice, to a conſiſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy ſomewhat more ſolid than a ſyrup in Cord all Lozenges; two ounces of ſugar often go to one dram of powder, the quantity where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſhould be by ſo much leſſer, by how much the quality is ſtronger, and the ſapour more ingratefull.</p>
                        <p>But Phyſicians ſhould define a juſt quantity of ſugar or honey,
<note place="margin">Medicorum error.</note> for while they preſcribe onely according to their cuſtome, as much as will ſerve of either indefinitly, they leave the Apothecary doubtfull in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Electuary, and they commit the ſick perſons ſafety to his judgement; for he may make the ſtrength of the Medicament more weak, or more intenſe, as he pleaſes, and you ſhall ſcarce find two Apothecaryes who put the ſame proportion of ſugar or honey to the ſame remedy, when the quantity is not preſcribed.</p>
                        <p>In the Confecture of the liquid Antidote,
<note place="margin">Electuarium liquidum fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciendi modus.</note> the honey is waſhed with a little water, and boyled by little and little on a moderate fire, and deſpumed, till the water, or other liquor be exhaled, then it is taken off the fire, and before it be abſolute cold, three ounces of the mixed powders are ſprinkled upon the honey, every pound of honey ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:37350:88"/>requires three ounces of Powder, and then they are mixed with a woodden poſtell, till the mixture be equall.</p>
                        <p>The weight of honey ſhould not be changed, becauſe of the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the pulpe of <hi>Caſſia,</hi> Tamarinds, or <hi>Manna,</hi> Dactyls, and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds, or other fruits, for in confecting an Electuary of a Legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate conſiſtency, the weight of dry powders muſt be anſwerable to the ſape, honey, or ſugar.</p>
                        <p>A ſoft Electuary ſhould not be repoſed in a box, before it be tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly cold, leaſt its ſuperiour part be extrinſecally incruſted in a certain Membrane, it is betetr to let it be fermented, and the craſſitude equall.</p>
                        <p>Sugar alſo muſt be prepared before it receive powders for it ſhould be diſſolved in ſtillatitious water, or other fit liquour,
<note place="margin">Electuarium ſiccum faciendi modus.</note> and then be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpumed, and boyled ſoftly on a fire till it be thicker than a ſyrup, and till a drop thereof will not dilate it ſelf, and after a little refrigeration the ſeverall ſpecies muſt be by little and little added, confounded, and mixed with a Spatula till it have got its whoſe ſolidity and equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, then it muſt be laid on a marble before it be cold, and with the Spatula dilated and planed, when it is cold, it may be cut into Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zenges ſquare or round, of one, two, or three dramms weight, which after they be brought to the hardneſs of ſugar muſt be laid in boxes or Cheſts.</p>
                        <p>Of what conſiſtency ſoever the Electuary be; whether ſolid or ſoft, it preſerves the ſtrength of the ſimples, well and long. Yet doth the ſoft preſerve it longer than the ſolid, becauſe its humidity being grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, it more conſtraines the faculty of the Medicaments, and hinders them from being diſſipated by the air.</p>
                        <p>By how much an Electuary is more gratefull to the Palate, by ſo much the ſooner doth its energy and faculty decay, for its efficacie will ſcarce endure a year, bitter; and ingratefull will endure two or three years, and the Antidote againſt wild beaſts bitings, or poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, ſometimes ten years without damage.</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>Galen</hi> hath obſerved (<hi>Cap.</hi> 5. <hi>lib.</hi> 7. <hi>comp. med. loc.</hi>) ſuch vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement vexations and torments in Colicall dolours,

And we ſhall begin our explication of local Medicaments with Oil, which by right vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates the firſt place to it ſelf; becauſe the Apothecary may want ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Medicaments, but ſcarce Oil at all, (<hi>Gal. cap.</hi> 3. <hi>lib.</hi> 6. <hi>ſimpl. med.</hi>)
<note place="margin">Oleum alimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum eſt &amp; me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicamentum.</note> For it is not onely brought to the table becauſe it is ſweet, and expreſſed out of mature Olives, for hereunto we underſtand the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination of Oil properly attributed; but the very baſis of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guents, Plaiſters, and Sear-cloaths, and the common bond of thoſe Simples whereof they are confected. And becauſe it is of it ſelf temperate, or hot and moyſt in the firſt degree, or as <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith, (<hi>cap.</hi> 25. <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>ſimpl. medic.</hi>) becauſe it is a medium betwixt hot and cold, moyſt and dry Medicaments, it helps laſſitude and weariſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, leniates aſperities, mollifies and cleanſes the ſqualid skin, and both wholſomely and pleaſantly cures many affections, which he mentioneth, (<hi>cap,</hi> 6, <hi>&amp;</hi> 7. <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>ſimpl. medic.</hi>)</p>
                           <p>Now Oils which are frequently uſed,
<note place="margin">Oleorum diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentiae.</note> are either ſimple or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound; thoſe are ſimple which are homogeneal, and receive nothing from Art but extraction, which is made without the mixture of other things.
<note place="margin">Pallas inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix olei.</note> After which manner <hi>Minerva</hi> firſt educed Oil, and taught that Art, as <hi>Diodorus</hi> writes; for before her Garden there was an
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:37350:92"/>Olive tree unknown to all, as alſo the uſe of Oil, which before that time no man had taught how to educe.</p>
                           <p>And almoſt all Oils drawn out by expreſſion are ſimple, as Oils ſimply ſo called, which is expreſſed out of mature Olives, Omotribes,
<note place="margin">Oleum omotri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bes.</note> or Omphacinum, which is of unripe Olives; as alſo Oil of Almonds, Wallnuts, and other Fruits, as other Oils educed out of Seeds, which differ even as the Seeds: for hot Oil is extracted out of hot Seeds, and cold out of cold Seeds. Yet all Oils are ſomewhat changed with age; and becauſe of the diſſipation from the watry part, that which is hot becomes hotter, and the cold refrigerates more ſlowly; for old Oil, according to <hi>Galen, (cap.</hi> 6. <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>compoſ. medic. ſecundum gener.</hi>) hath power to extenuate; which is an effect of heat.</p>
                           <p>Oil alſo, according to the diverſity of the Fruit out of which it is extracted, as being mature or immature, and according to the manner of preparation and alteration induced by Art, acquires another and different quality and efficacy in alteration. As for example,
<note place="margin">Oleum ovorum</note> Oil of Egs yolks, though it be not perfectly mixed, yet by loſing ſome hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midity by its preparation, it is more hot and dry, and is a Medicine moſt uſefull in ſmoothing the skin, and curing an impetiginous itch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and other affectious of the skin, as alſo ſome fiſtulous and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lign ulcers.</p>
                           <p>The ſame quality happens to all, expreſſed by the force of the fire, from which they perpetually retain their acquired heat.
<note place="margin">Olei amygdali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni facultas.</note> And when Oil of Almonds is thus extracted, it is onely extrinſecally applyed; when without fire, it is ſucked up like a gratefull Lohoch, to eaſe the aſperity of the rough artery, and coct and move Spittle; ſo that it is oft given with a little Sugar to Children that are troubled with coughing, or that have any diſtillation from the brain to the lungs, without any purging Medicaments, eſpecially without anodynal Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments.</p>
                           <p>That Oils may be extracted, the Fruits and Seeds ſhould firſt be purged, and the Apothecaries do ill that extract Oil out of Almonds before decortication. The Seeds cleanſed, are brayed with a peſtel;
<note place="margin">Olea exprimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di modus.</note> after contuſion they are put into a pan, and ſet upon the fire, and ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red pretty long, that they may calefy: then are they involved in a rough cloth, and ſubjected to a wooden preſs, till by valid compreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion the Oils be expreſſed.</p>
                           <p>Thoſe that we would educe without the help of fire or heat, muſt after they be bruiſed very ſmall, be preſently put into the preſs, that the Oil may exude by drops.</p>
                           <p>Petreol, which is educed out of Salt-petre, from whence it hath its denomination, takes place amongſt ſimple Oils. But our purpoſe is to treat of ſuch as are made by Art. Liquidambor and Balſam alſo are ſimple Oils, which diſtill by drops out of the inciſions of forreign Trees. But more of this in our Shop.</p>
                           <p>Some ſimple Oils alſo are diſtilled ſometimes as well by aſcent as by deſcent, as out of Juniper, <hi>Guaiacum,</hi> Cloves, and ſuch like,
<note place="margin">Olea educta per aſcenſum &amp; deſcenſum.</note> both
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:37350:93"/>wood and dry Fruits, which being put into a pot, Oil aſcends into the veſſel above, by virtue of the fire ſet under; or deſcends into the veſſel ſet under, by virtue of the fire above. Yet are not all Oils ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted by deſcent, nor alwayes by the help of the fire; for Oil may eaſily exude out of <hi>Tartarum</hi> and Myrrhe included in a bag, and ſuſpended in a moyſt place, as in a Wine-cellar. Of all which man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of educing Oils, more elſewhere.</p>
                           <p>But compound Oils, wherewith the Apothecary ſhould be eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially furniſhed, are ſuch, in which the matter of ſtocks, fruits, flowers, and of any ſimple, is infuſed and macerated. After which, the whole is inſolated, till the ſtrength of the matter remain in the Oil, which is afterwards expreſſed and repoſed. After this manner are made the Oil of Violets, Roſes, St. <hi>Johns</hi> wort, Water-lillies, and many more, which the Greeks call <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap>, the Latines <hi>Unguenta;</hi> and eſpecially thoſe which may be inſpiſſated by the admiſtion of gums, and odoriferous things; whence they are called Myropolitans, or Unguentarians, who ſold ſuch Oils and Unguents as were ſuaveolent, with whom any fragrant Oil was taken for an Unguent, as Unguents for Oils.</p>
                           <p>We ſcarce approve of their opinion which call onely them ſimple Oils which are made of Flowers, Fruits, or other Simples infuſed, macerated and inſolated in Oil of Olives: and thoſe compound Oils which are cocted on a ſlow fire with wine, water, infuſion, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient decoction, till almoſt all the admixed humour be aſſumed; for thoſe ſeem no leſs, but rather more compound than theſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe not onely the total power of the things infuſed, but a good por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſubſtance in which it inheres, remains with the Oil after expreſſion in the former. Hence that Oil which partakes of no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, but is temperate, is ſuch perpetually from the condition of the thing infuſed; which if cold, then is the Oil cold; if hot, hot; if it have the power to exſiccate, then will the Oil exſiccate.</p>
                           <p>Such Oils as are educed by expreſſion onely,
<note place="margin">Quibus vaſis olea ſervanda.</note> or by maceration and expreſſion together, may be moſt ſafely kept, if repoſed in veſſels of glaſs or clay, perfectly before hardned with the valid heat of a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace. But ſuch as are educed by diſtillation, whether by aſcent or deſcent, which are commonly called Chymiſts eſſences, muſt alwayes be kept in ſolid glaſs veſſels with ſtrait orifices, cloſe covered, left their ſubſtance and quality being diſſipable, ſoon expire.</p>

                           <p>UNguents, as <hi>Galen</hi> teſtifies, (<hi>cap. ult. lib.</hi> 7. <hi>ſimpl. med.</hi>) were called by the Antients, Oily Medicaments, confected of ſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veolent ſpices; and according to <hi>Actuarius,</hi> (<hi>cap.</hi> 1. <hi>lib.</hi> 5. <hi>meth.</hi>) are onely externally applyed, and being onely ſpread along, are thought to benefit but ſuch parts as cannot endure other reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; ſuch parts, as <hi>Oribaſius,</hi> (<hi>cap.</hi> 27. <hi>lib. collect.</hi>) ſaith, are grieved with Cataplaſms, and hurt with fluent madefactions.</p>
                           <p>Now Unguents are of a groſſer conſiſtency than Oils, and a mean betwixt Oils and Plaiſters, as Liniments betwix: Oils and Unguents; for a more liquid Unguent is called very often a Liniment;
<note place="margin">Unguenta cur dicta &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venta.</note> of the confection and uſe whereof, we ſhall treat more at large in the fifth Chapter. And becauſe the conſiſtency of Unguents, Liniments, and Sear-cloaths, do not much differ, they are uſed ſometimes indiſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; for that is called a Liniment, wherewith the parts to be helped are liniated; that an Unguent, wherewith they are anointed; and that a Sear-cloth, which made of Wax and Oil, is applyed.</p>
                           <p>The Arabians under the name of Unguents, oft comprehend Sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloaths and Plaiſters, and many thick Oils; and the antient Greeks all well ſmelled Ointments; ſo <hi>Dioſcorides,</hi> (<hi>lib.</hi> 1.) calls many ſweet Oils, Unguents; and <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> (<hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de medic.</hi>) affirms, that Phyſicians ſhould not onely get fame and glory of the Vulgar by the good conſtitutions of their bodies, and decent Ornaments, but by ſweet Unguents, that is, by aromatical and ſuaveolent things.</p>
                           <p>Yet for clearer explications ſake they are diſtinguiſhed from one another: and an Unguent properly is an Oily Medicament,
<note place="margin">Unguentum quid.</note> of a middle conſiſtency betwixt Oils and Plaiſters, which yet doth not ſtill remain alike: for when heat is more vehement, the unctious and fat matter melts more, and the Unguents become more liquid and ſoft; and when the heat is weaker, more ſolid: and therefore Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guentarians uſe to put leſs Oil in Summer, and more in Winter to their Unguents; for cold inſpiſſates a fluent Unguent, as Oil it ſelf; which <hi>Galen</hi> obſerves, (<hi>cap.</hi> 1. <hi>lib.</hi> 8. <hi>comp. med. gener.</hi>) in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of his ſtomachical Sear-cloth.</p>
                           <p>Now that proportion of Oil muſt be obſerved in the confection of Unguents, that to one ounce of Oil be mixed one dram of Powder,
<note place="margin">Olei proportio in unguento<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum confectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne.</note> and two drams of Wax; or as <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith, (<hi>cap.</hi> 2. <hi>lib.</hi> 4. <hi>comp. med. gener.</hi>) that four times as much Oil as Wax be put in the confection of Unguents, and eight times as much Oil as Powder, that is, to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ounce of Oil muſt be put a dram of Powder, the matter whereof is educed out of dry Herbs, Metals, and Earth, which is mixed with
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:37350:94"/>a cold Cerate, and ſtirred with a <hi>Spatula,</hi> till all lumps be levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated.</p>
                           <p>When Unguents receive dry juices, we muſt pulverate and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve them; when liquid and fluent, we muſt mix them with the reſt of the matter, and by coction abſume them.</p>
                           <p>Such as may, ſhould be pulverated very ſmall, as Roots, Wood, Roſines, and ſometimes Gums, when dryer. Such as may not, ſhould be beaten with a hot peſtel till they be mollified, or elſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved in Vinegar, or ſome fit liquor.</p>
                           <p>Such as are more humid, as Turpontine, ſhould be inſtilled; hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mid Herbs alſo, and Animals, or parts thereof that are ſcarce pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verable, ſhould be perfectly cocted in wine or ſuch liquor, till they be tabefied, and their humidity almoſt abſumed: then muſt materials be mixed in the ſtrained liquor, according to the aforeſaid proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that the Unguent may be of a legitimate conſiſtency; wherein Oil and Wax do not onely afford form, and a great part of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the Unguent, but conjoyn the efficacies of the other mixtures, and preſerve them longer.</p>
                           <p>Now Unguents are made one while by the fire,
<note place="margin">Vnguentum crudum.</note> as all ſuch as ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit Wax; another while onely by long ſubaction, as ſuch that receive no Wax, as the crude Unguent, or the Unguent of Lithargy, which is made of Oil, Vinegar, and Lithargy, coacted by the continual per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion of a peſtel.</p>
                           <p>There are alſo differences of Unguents taken from their colour,
<note place="margin">Vnguentarum varietates.</note> as green, white, yellow, and orange colour; from their effects, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptive, analeptical, cleanſing; from their firſt qualities, whence ſome are ſaid to be hot, as the <hi>Unguentum Apoſtolorum, Aegyptia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum, Martiatum, Enula campane;</hi> others cold, as <hi>Unguentum Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tritum;</hi> others dry, as <hi>Diapompholios, &amp; deſicca Rubruni;</hi> others moyſtning, as the Unguent of Roſes.</p>
                           <p>But white Wax is more expetible to the confection of cold, and yellow to the confection of hot Unguents. But Apothecaries in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſtinctly take one while white, another while yellow, as the matter of either will afford more commodity.</p>
                           <p>Unguents are repoſed in tin boxes,
<note place="margin">Quibus vaſis unguenta re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponenda.</note> and ſometimes in earthen pots well glazed, and they will keep a whole year, ſometimes two or three.</p>

                           </head>
                           <p>
                              <hi>CErata</hi> are often deſigned by Unguents, <hi>Ceronea</hi> by Plaiſters: by Unguents, becauſe ſofter; by Plaiſters, becauſe harder: Both ſo called, becauſe they admit of Wax, as many Plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, which are therefore indiſtinctly called Ceroneous Plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, of them that apply Catagmatical Plaiſters to all diſeaſes, bought in Unguentarians Shops: ſo that Ceroneous Salves are ſo uſual a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Vulgar, that they call all Salves Ceroneous. A certain man in <hi>Lutetia</hi> calls a certain Plaiſter Ceroneous, which he applyed to all pains and diſeaſes.</p>
                           <p>But <hi>Ceratum,</hi> of which we now ſpeak,
<note place="margin">Ceratum quid.</note> is a Medicament of a middle conſiſtency betwixt an Unguent and a Plaiſter; not ſo ſolid as a Plaiſter, nor ſo ſoft as an Unguent. But every one augments or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſheth the weight of Oil, and makes this <hi>Ceratum</hi> either more li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid, or more ſolid than an Unguent, as he thinks fit. And indeed if it were prepared after one and the ſame manner, it would not be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferved ſo long ſafely;
<note place="margin">Olei quantitas in Cerato non ſemper cadem.</note> for though any liquid thing may be eaſily concrete with cold and froſty weather, and a ſolid Unguent ſoon melted in hot weather, yet we mix more Oil and leſs Wax in Winter, and more Wax and leſs Oil in Summer in <hi>Ceratum.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>But when the conſtitution of the air is temperate, and doth not much exceed the firſt qualities, the fourth part of a pound of Wax, or not much more or leſs, ſhould be put to one pound of Oil, that the <hi>Ceratum</hi> may not melt, or be thickned by the change of weather. Yet it is ſeldome kept long in Apothecaries Shops, becauſe it may at any time, and ſoon be made of Oil and Wax, whence it is called <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratum,</hi> or more properly <hi>Cereole;</hi> for ſuch as beſides Oil and Wax admit other ingredients, is not ſo properly called <hi>Ceratum, Santali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> and ſtomachical <hi>Ceratum:</hi> and others which may preſently be made, as the matter requires, of Plaiſters melted with Oil, when the part affected cannot endure the hardneſs of a Salve or Plaiſter.</p>
                           <p>Thus is a certain <hi>Ceratum</hi> called <hi>Acopa,</hi> applyed to the weary nerves and muſcles of thoſe that are weak.</p>
                           <p>Thus may a <hi>Ceratum</hi> ſpread on leather, cut according to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of the place affected, be applyed to the region of the ſpleen, ventricle, liver, womb, and to broken bones.</p>
                           <p>That which is applyed to the ſpleen muſt be long,

                           <p>In the confection of <hi>Cereole,</hi> the Wax is cut ſmall,

                           <p>Seeing fatneſs, marrow, and ſuch like liquid things, are added to the <hi>Ceratum,</hi> improperly ſo called, they muſt be mixed with it while cold, as alſo the powders, the proportion whereof to Oil is the ſame with that in Unguents.</p>
                           <p>They may be repoſed in tin or clay veſſels: but it is better to have them new, ſeeing they may ſoon be made at any time.</p>

                           <p>THoſe topical Medicaments which are coacted into a more ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid lump, were called by the Arabians <hi>Cerota,</hi> and by the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Greeks <hi>Emplaſta,</hi> (<hi>Gal. cap.</hi> 12. <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>comp. medic. gen.</hi>) which the later ſort for euphonies ſake call, <hi>Empla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtra,</hi> the letter <hi>(r)</hi> being added; which being detracted, their qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity ſounds not emplaſtrical, but emplaſtical, or emphractical, as it were filling up or inſartiating. For an Emplaſter ſuper-induced upon a part, ſeems to ſhut the pores and paſſages thereof, by the viſcidity of its ſubſtance, and retain the halituous ſpirits, and by conſtraining the heat of the part ſometimes to move ſuppuration; for its glewiſh ſubſtance doth not inſinuate into it ſelf, but remaining without, doth tenaciouſly adhere to the paſſages of the body. Yet are not its quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties idle, but being moved and helped by the heat of the part, they produce ſeveral effects, (<hi>c.</hi> 9. <hi>l.</hi> 5. <hi>de ſimpl. med.</hi>) if its faculty be to conglutinate, it helps the coagulation of wounds in the lips; if it be catagmatical, it helps the ferrumination of broken bones; if it be ſarcotical,
<note place="margin">Sarcoſis non tam medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentorum quam naturae eſt opus.</note> herein it helps Nature, that it generates fleſh more eaſily; which is not ſo much the effect of Medicaments, as of Nature.</p>
                           <p>And as the compoſition of Emplaiſters is various and manifold, ſo alſo is their quality, for they are compounded almoſt of all Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caments; wherefore all are not emphractical, or ſuch as fill the pores with their lentor, but ſome are ecphractical, as it were purging fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures; others epiſaſtical, or extracting, and diaphoretical; others chyptical, which take away the filth of the skin, and ulcers; and ſome that are uſefull for many affections, as many other Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, called polychreſtical, which conſiſt of contrary Medicaments. (<hi>Gal. initio l.</hi> 5. <hi>comp. med. gener.</hi>)</p>
                           <pb n="125" facs="tcp:37350:95"/>
                           <p>An emplaſtical Medicament ſhould want all mordacity, for it can ſcarce ſtick to the pores, if any ſharp or biting quality be in it, as <hi>Galen,</hi> (<hi>cap.</hi> 9. <hi>lib.</hi> 5. <hi>comp. medic. gener.</hi>) but it may be eaſily diſcerned by melting ſome part of it, or by attracting ſome humour from above; an Emplaſtick therefore ſhould be of a terrene ſubſtance, and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcous.</p>
                           <p>There are two main ſcopes in compounded Emplaiſters to be min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that a ſolid and groſs conſiſtency, and faculty, odour and colour are often deſired; which rather pleaſe the fancy of the diſeaſed, than conduce any thing in effect to the nature of the Medicament.</p>
                           <p>Wax, and common Oil, Lithargy, and ſometimes Roſines, do afford a fit conſiſtency and matter, but ſmall or no virtue. All things almoſt which are ſuperadded, as Minerals, Metals, Roots, Wood, Flowers, and Seeds, give a body and faculty to the Plaiſter; which if they be dry, they muſt be pulverated and mixed with the Plaiſter removed from the fire; if any of them be not friable, they are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved in ſome liquor, which is abſumed by coction, before they be mixed with the Plaiſter; or elſe it is mixed with the Plaiſter, and diſſipated by coction afterwards.</p>
                           <p>Green herbs, which cannot be pulverated, are either cocted in their own juice ſtrained and mixed, or others are cocted in the juice of theſe brayed and ſtrained; which juice being abſumed, the ſtrength thereof being left, if any remains that will not endure long coction, they may be put in and cocted, and then mixed with the Plaiſter.</p>
                           <p>But thoſe Emplaiſters muſt be long boyled which receive juice, water, vinegar, wine, or ſome decoction; becauſe whereas the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſter ſhould be all viſcid and thick, that it might ſtick to the place to which it is applyed, humidity, which is oft mixt with it, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to viſcidity, muſt be reſolved by heat, if its quality muſt needs be retained in the Emplaſter; for ſuch as are cocted in juices keep their faculties, though the juices themſelves be diſſipated by exhala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Humidity alſo, which is required in confecting Plaiſters, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes that the virtues of the reſt of the ingredients be ſurer ingrafted, and that they be carried to parts further diſtant. Oil indeed is added to the materials of Emplaiſters, but not as to conſtitute their body, but that the Wax might be melted with it, and that it might obtund the ſharp and auſtere ingredients, and that the Emplaiſters may obtain a more pleaſant and leniating faculty.</p>
                           <p>Simple old Oil, and Oil made by infuſion, as alſo any compound Oil, may be put into the Emplaiſter, that beſides its matter, it may alſo afford ſome virtue thereunto.</p>
                           <p>Wax, as alſo ſome Roſines, allow onely matter to Emplaiſters, no power to act. Yet ſuch Emplaſters as have other matter analogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal to them, as Frankincenſe, and
<note n="*" place="margin">The dew of <hi>Lada.</hi>
                              </note> 
                              <hi>Labdanum,</hi> or ſuch like Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, admit of no Wax nor Roſines in their compoſition.</p>
                           <p>But if Wax ingrede the Emplaiſter, let it be melted in Oil; if Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thargy, let that alſo be boyled in Oil; and if Juices, Liquors, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:37350:96"/>ſuch like muſt be mixed with it, let them alſo be warmed with theſe, till the watry and humid portion be reſolved: then let Roſines and Fats be induced, as alſo Gums, whereof ſome are mixed ſimply with it, others after maceration in Wine, Oil, or Vinegar, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colation. When the Plaiſter is throughly boyled, and taken from the fire, let Turpentine be mixed therewith, that it may not feel any force of fire. Laſt of all, when all theſe are confounded, and cocted to a legitimate conſiſtency, and refrigerated, let the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders be by little and little ſcattered above all, and diligently agitated and moved with a Spatula, till all be compact into a maſs, neither too ſoft nor too hard, but viſcid, glewiſh, and adherent: yet not ſo as to inquinate the part to which it adheres, nor to be hardly divelled from the place whereunto it is applyed.</p>
                           <p>And that the form of it may exiſt in a due conſiſtency, the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Oil muſt be diminiſhed: when Fats, Marrows, and Turpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine are admitted in its confection, and augmented, when dry Gums, friable Juices, Roſines, and dry Wood or Minerals, that may be pulverated, are mixed therewith.</p>
                           <p>In dry Ingredients the Oil muſt be thus proportioned;
<note place="margin">Olci proportio in emplaſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum confectura</note> to every ounce of Powder muſt be allowed three ounces of Oil: to Wax the fourth part of as much Oil as the Wax is in quantity will ſerve; ſo that to a pound of Wax we put a quarter of a pound of Oil.</p>
                           <p>But becauſe this quantity in the tempering of moſt Emplaiſters may be better deſigned by ones judgement, than defined by certain rules, they now adayes put to a definite quantity of Oil and Powders as much Wax as will ſuffice, that theſe liquid, dry, and viſcid ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients, being by malaxation coagulated, a fit, viſcous and glewiſh maſs of Emplaiſters may be induced. Out of which maſs are formed rowls of Plaiſters of half an ounce, or a whole ounce weight, which being involved in oiled papers, are repoſed in the Apothecaries Shop for future uſes.</p>
                           <p>Thus alſo are Emplaiſters, properly ſo called, made, which are prepared without Fire and Wax, whoſe materials malaxated in Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, or ſome viſcid matter, are coagulated into the conſiſtency of an Emplaiſter, as <hi>Emplaſtra de cruſta panis,</hi> and <hi>de baccis lauri,</hi> or other ſuch common Emplaiſters, which are a medium betwixt Plaiſters and Cataplaſms.</p>
                           <p>That <hi>Ceratum,</hi> confected of an equal weight of Wax and Honey, is alſo referred to Emplaiſters, as alſo <hi>Cerotum</hi> or <hi>Ceronea,</hi> of which before.</p>

<note place="margin">Tela Galterii.</note> ſometimes alſo <hi>Galterius</hi> his Cloth, peradventure becauſe he was the Inventor, or rather Infector thereof. Which is thus made; a certain Cloth ſomewhat bare with wearing, is often dipped and inculcated in a fit Emplaiſter already made up, but now melted till it be all infected, inquinated, and on every ſide incruſted; which is then extracted and expoſed to the air, that by refrigeration it may become obdurate, and ſo be preſerved till future exigency.</p>
                           <p>Now hereof are many kinds, the differences whereof ariſe not from the Cloth, but the Emplaiſters wherein it is dipped; for ſome are catagmatical, which are uſed in ſolidating and roborating broken bones, which are made of aſtringing and roborating Emplaſticks: as,</p>

                        </head>
                        <p>IN preſcribing a Medicament, we ſhould firſt appoint a baſis, that is, ſome ſimple Medicament, as the chief in that compoſition, and moſt fit for depelling the diſeaſe, upon which the reſt may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend. As when we undertake to oppugn any diſeaſe, if it be ſimple, accompanied with no ill ſymptome, we chooſe onely a ſimple Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cament of an equal virtue, and juſt auxiliary: but if no Simple be apt for it, then we muſt compound one Medicament of many, the baſis whereof muſt be averſe to the diſeaſe; and adde others, which may corroborate the member affected, or carry the quality of the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cament to the parts more diſtant. Others alſo we muſt adjoin to make it acceptable and gratefull to the palate, or to felicitate and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitate the work.</p>
                        <p>Now the baſis is for the moſt part more prepollent in quality that in quantity, as in aromatical and purgative Confections; and by how much the diſeaſe to be depelled is more grievous, by ſo much muſt the baſis be more potent in its virtue.
<note place="margin">Muitae baſes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquando in uno medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mento.</note> Often alſo are many baſis confuſedly digeſted into ſome Compound, for the expugning of ſome prave affection; which conſpiring with their mutual help, make up one perfect baſis; as when we confound many anodynous Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments to eaſe ſome vehement dolour.</p>
                        <p>Therefore in compounding Medicaments, a baſis muſt be firſt ſought adequate to the affection, and the part affected, yet it muſt not alwayes take the firſt place in compoſition: for all the ingredients in a Compoſition muſt not be promiſcuouſly and inordinately confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded together, but one after another. And when this order is negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, the Medicament oft times neither acquires its juſt virtue, nor its apt form; for if thoſe receive little which require much and long coction, and thoſe much which require little, their virtue cannot be integrally procured.</p>
                        <p>A due order likewiſe is accurately to be obſerved in deſcribing
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:37350:98"/>forms of Medicaments or Receipts,

                        <p>But they offend worſe, who boyl thoſe Medicaments long, whoſe virtues are impaired by fire; who give thoſe Medicaments in drink, which becauſe of their eminent bitterneſs ſhould be made into Pills, and covered over; who adminiſter thoſe things raw, which ſhould be cocted, thoſe whole, which ſhould be pulverated, and thoſe diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved without expreſſion, which ſhould onely be infuſed.</p>
                        <p>Thoſe who through negligence omit theſe things, may ſcarcely eſchew the cenſure of the more antient Apothecaries, who being taught by skilfull Phyſicians, have not onely found out the manner of compounding Medicaments, but many of them have attained the knowledge of the order wherein Simples ſhould be ſeverally collo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated.</p>

                        <head>CHAP. III. <hi>Of the forms and end of Medicaments.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p>AS thoſe that are ſound in body do not need, (<hi>Aphor.</hi> 37. <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Hippoc.</hi>) ſo neither do they deſire Medicines. And thoſe who had need of Medicaments, either to prevent an imminent, or depell a preſent diſeaſe, either never call the Phyſician till the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady of the diſeaſe be at the height, or utterly refuſe Phyſick; or they will have it prepared with ſuch art and mixture, as in odour, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and ſapour, it may pleaſe the noſe, eyes, and palate. But <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len,</hi> (<hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de praenot.</hi>) ſaith, that a Cook amongſt theſe children and fools is preferred before a Phyſician; and he is more commended and allauded, becauſe he daily indulges their genius with unaccuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med varieties and dainties.</p>
                        <p>But ſince every one is puniſhed by that by which he offended, and gluttony and ſurfetting is the nurſe almoſt of all diſeaſes, it is as it were by divine ordination conſtituted, that a Medicament aſſumed by the mouth, ſhould leave in the mouth the ultion of the fault there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in committed. For it is no wonder that almoſt all Medicaments, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially purgative, ſhould ſo much diſpleaſe our taſte and ſmell, by their quality averſe to our nature, ſince they are inſtituted, not as Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to be changed, but to change; and either to correct the noxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous quality of the humours, or to extrude it.</p>
                        <p>Such Medicaments as are inſipid and inodorous, and being exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited in a ſmall quantity, do variouſly wreſt and exagitate the body, and the humours, are not ſo good as thoſe, which though ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and aſſumed in a larger meaſure, do eaſily and with delight e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the vicious humours from the parts affected.</p>
                        <p>Now the forms of Medicaments do not onely facilitate their aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumpſion,
<note place="margin">Forma medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentorum quid praeſtat.</note> (for ſome onely like liquid, others ſolid Medicines) but produce divers effects, as they are in form divers; for an inciding or extenuating Medicament is better accommodated to its function by a liquid form, as alſo by a ſolid form to aſtriction.</p>
                        <p>Now I call not that ſame, which gives the eſſence, the thing; nor yet that faculty, by which it operates, the form, but the very conſiſtency of the compound Medicament, whether it be ſolid, liquid, or in a mean. Beſides which conſiſtency, another figure is often put upon dry Medicaments by the induſtrious hand of the Apothecary, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed by ſome ſigil; as when the matter is formed into Pils or Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chisks, or planed into Teſſels; and that either equilaterally cubal, or drawn out into an unequal angle.</p>
                        <p>But this external impreſſed form or ſigillation is of little moment,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:37350:99"/>as nothing conducing either to promote or felicitate the effect of the Medicament, as ſome ſuperſtitious fellows have imagined, that I may omit what ſome Alchymiſts dream of, the external ſignature of ſome Plants, whereby they profeſs to accommodate the virtues of thoſe Plants to the parts affected, with which their Medicaments by certain marks and external forms agree. But the form of a Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whereby it is denſe, rare, or liquid, is uſefull for many pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, for the ſame Medicament will ſometimes provoke urine, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſtools, according to the manner of its compoſition. <hi>Galen, cap.</hi> 13. <hi>lib.</hi> 4. <hi>de ſanit. tuend.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Such Medicaments as are levigated to powder,
<note place="margin">Craſſities aut tenuitas pulve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum quid effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciat.</note> are quickly car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to the reins and bladder; ſuch as are groſſer, ſubſiſt longer in the inteſtines, and give ſtools. If any would be freed from obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and move monthly flowers, they can neither ſucceſsfully exhibit ſolid Medicaments, nor yet liquid ones, if they would educe the noxious humour from the brain, or parts more diſſite.</p>
                        <p>And as groſſer Medicaments are requiſite to roborate ſome parts, and depell ſome affections, and liquid to others: ſo ſome require Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments of a middle conſiſtency, as amongſt internal Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Electuaries, and ſome Antidotes amongſt external Unguents, mucaginous Salves, and Pultiſes.</p>
                        <p>We have abundantly before declared what form is fit for ſeveral Medicaments, we ſhall hereafter ſpeak in ſpecial of thoſe which ſhould be variouſly formed, as the condition of the place requires, to which they are fitted; as when a <hi>ſcutum</hi> or ſignature of a Buckler is fitted for the region of the ventricle, of a ſtomachical Emplaiſter, a Peſſary for the ſecrets, a Suppoſitory for the fundament, a Tent for a wound.</p>
                        <p>Some upon no grounds do not onely deſire a ſet form,

                        <p>So many little regard excellent Medicaments, if they know them, but make much of vile ones, if they know them not, admiring them as ſome celeſtial remedy.
<note place="margin">Artis arcana non detegenda.</note> They therefore act to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignity of Medicaments, who detect the ſecrets of ſo Divine an Art; and that they may pleaſe the people, deſcribe their Receipts in the vulgar idiome.</p>
                        <p>For it is better to make a Medicament gratis, and give it to the poor, than preſcribe them any thing of ſmall price, or teach and ſhew the compoſition thereof; which they having once with ſucceſs tryed upon themſelves, they will experience on others to their undoing; for many Medicaments, eſpecially purgative, are both good and evil, and heals or kils accordingly, as they are well or ill uſed.</p>
                        <pb n="134" facs="tcp:37350:100"/>
                        <p>Now the end of compoſition of Medicaments is the cauſe for which ſuch compoſition muſt be undertaken;
<note place="margin">Finis compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitionis.</note> or that ſame purpoſe to which all things neceſſary in compoſition are referred, that the Medicaments compounded by Art may be of uſe, either to preſerve or roborate health, or to profligate difeaſes.</p>

                        <p>EVery Nation and Countrey had, and have ſtill their proper Weights and Meaſures; the Conſtinopolitan Merchants two pounds Weights, twenty ſix ounces; the Mediolanians 24. the Pariſienſians 16. the Lugdunians 15. the Hiſpanians 14. the Genevians, and many more 12. the Goldſmiths onely 8. common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called <hi>Markum.</hi>

                        <p>The antient Greeks, Arabians, and Romanes alſo, had not onely their proper Idioms and Characters, but Weights alſo; and unleſs the Supream Authority forbad them, they would buy with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, and fell with the leaſt Weights, there being no certain Standard.</p>
                        <p>But becauſe in Medicine one cannot erre twice; and errours in preſcribing Weights and Meaſures are often very perilous, all Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicks ſhould have common and definite Weights, that there might be a mutual conſent in their operations.</p>
                        <p>The Medicks pound alwayes weighs 12. ounces, which is thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, <hi>lib. j.</hi> their ounce eight drams, whoſe note is this, ℥. <hi>j.</hi> their dram three ſcruples, thus marked, <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>. <hi>j.</hi> ſo that in one ounce they have as many ſcruples as there be letters in the Greek Alphabet, to wit, 24. according to the Poet <hi>Faunus:</hi>

                        </head>
                        <p>IT is not onely worthy our inquiſition in compounding Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to enquire after the quality of ſimples onely, but alſo to know in what quantity each ſimple ſhould be mixed, &amp; what quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of a compound ſhould be exhibited. For as too little brings ſmall emolument or profit, ſo too much brings more harme: for a Lettice may kill as well as Hemlock; and wine kills more than Woolfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bane.</p>
                        <p>Now if ſuperabundance of Aliment be as noxious as poyſon,
<note place="margin">Alimentorum nimia quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas periculoſa.</note> it is the greateſt perfection of the Art &amp; Artificer to deſcribe the juſt quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Medicaments, and to define what and how much is convenient for every ſexe, age, nature, and time: For <hi>Turpethum,</hi> colocynthis and Hellebore purge ſtrongly; Polypody, Tamarinds, and the broath of an old Cock weakely: <hi>Caſſia,</hi> Senny, Rhabarbe, moderately:
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:37350:102"/>old and melanchollick men muſt be purged hardly in Autumne, boyes and moiſt men muſt be purged eaſily in Winter, and Spring; and cholerick men eaſily in Summer, ſuch as are of a middle nature, muſt be moderately purged.</p>
                        <p>And ſince mutations of ages and ſeaſons change the condition of the humours,
<note place="margin">Idem medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum non eadem ſemper praeſtat.</note> it happens that one and the ſame Medicament, taken in the ſame quantity, hath not alwayes the ſame effect and operation, for when the humours ſwell, and are turbulent, then nature, with the help of a gentle Medicament, will worke out the excretion of the trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome matter, excluding it either by ſtoole or vomit. Whereas on the contrary, if the matter by its lentour be more tenaciouſly fixed, and no way provokes nature by its quality to its excluſion; the ſtrongeſt Medicament will not be of power to relaxe the belly, being only able to move, not to remove theſe redundant humours.</p>
                        <p>This diverſity of humours often deceives the non-cautious, who having by experience found, that <hi>Caſſia</hi> ſhould be preſcribed and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited by <hi>ounces,</hi> and not by <hi>grains, Scammony</hi> by <hi>grains</hi> and not by <hi>ounces,</hi> and Rhabarb by <hi>drams;</hi> think they have preſcribed a conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient doſis according to the efficacy of each Medicaments acting, when yet they often ſee that the Medicament either not at all, or too impenſely and ſtrongly moves the belly: For when nature coope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, and the ſuperfluous humour ſwells, a few grains of Rhabarb will relaxe, yea, the very odour alone of ſome catharticke, will ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently exagitate the ventricle.</p>
                        <p>Wherefore the Phyſician does wiſely, who being called by ſome patient never before ſeen of him, askes him whether his body needs a weake and gentle, or valid and ſtrong purge, and whether he be moſt commonly laxative, or reſtringed, that he may the better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comodate his purgative Medicament; neither too much, nor too little to exagitate his ventricle, nor yet to exclude more in quantity or qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity than he ſhould. Yet if the body wholly abound with ill humours, he may not at once, but by little and little, not on one day, but many remove them, for nature cannot beare great evacuations of any humours whatſoever, but delights in graduall actions, wherein is no violence.</p>

                        <p>THE Medicinary Art is indeed conjecturall, yet much hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped by experience, augmented by reaſon, and confirmed by reaſon, and confirmed by the authority of Doctors, who trying effects by the indagation of cauſes, and being more skilfull and prudent by long obſervance have left Theorems to po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity, grounded upon many ſtrong and neceſſary reaſons, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by diſeaſes may be known, remedies invented, and a quantity of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments deſcribed, if not juſt and definite, yet ſo accomodate to nature and the diſeaſe, that one may triumph, and the other be capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated: For what perill can be doubted or expected? If where an ounce of <hi>Caſſia</hi> is convenient, ſeven or nine drams be exhibited, if where oue dram of Rhabarb is requiſite, two or four ſcruples be aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, a ſmall errour ſhould not cauſe great feare, and as all excremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titious humours cannot alwayes be educed by a Medicament without indangering ſanity; ſo we ſhall not need to ſuſpect any harme by the eduction of ſome of them onely that are not of an offenſive quality: ſince meat and drink are not alwayes ingeſted after the ſame meaſere, and at the ſame time. Nor yet ill humours always bridg diſeaſes with them. Many have often eaten Hemlock inſtead of Perſly in Pottage, which the maid hath miſtaken, becauſe of their convenience in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall form, thoſe alſo who love Froggs eat Toad ſtools often with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out harm.</p>
                        <p>Yet we muſt with all judgement and artificiall conjecture, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to make the quantity of the Medicament, reſpond to the ſtrength of the nature, and the burthen to be educed, which if it be copious, and a proportionate Medicament, cannot with ſafety be exhibited at once, it is better to waſh it away in ſeverall dayes than at once, both deject ſtrength and humours.</p>

For ſuppurgation is dangerous, which by too much opening the veins ſometimes excites the dyſentary, evacuates blood, and proſtrates the integrity of natures ſtrength to danger. Its better therefore to relinquiſh ſome of the ſuperfluous humours, than by immoderate vacuation to protrude both neceſſary and excremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titious ones.</p>
                        <p>And as the ſame quantity of the ſame Medicament given to the
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:37350:103"/>ſame man at ſeverall times, may produce different effects, ſo as its quantity varyes it acts variouſly, &amp; one while is more proper for this, another while for that diſeaſe: for if (<hi>Aphor.</hi> 1. <hi>lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Hippocr.</hi>) a woman with child be adviſed to purge, which ſhe may without fear or danger do, betwixt the fourth and ſixth moneth of her pregnancy, ſhe may confidently aſſume a roborating Medicament in a ſmall quantity, that the cauſe of that moleſtation, whereof pregnant women complain, may be gently removed, and the <hi>foetus</hi> receive no detriment there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by.</p>
                        <p>But when the quantity of <hi>Opium, Diagredium,</hi> or ſuch Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which have great power, in a little bigneſs, is to be excoginted, let it be with great care and prudence preſcribed, and pondered, that if a juſt quantity can ſcarce be defined, the exoberance or defect may be very ſmall, for whereas the leaſt thing is not reached by the Law, nor judged by the Praetor, yet we may cafily offend in the leaſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe.</p>

                        <head>CHAP. VIII. <hi>Of ſuch Medicaments as may without harme be taken in great quantity, for whom they are convenient and when.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p>Every Medicament doth more or leſſe offend nature, as its fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oulty is ſtronger or weaker: by how much a catharticke is more grievous in odour or ſapour, by ſo much it cauſes more mole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation; for all purges (ſaith <hi>Galen. cap. ult. lib. quos, quando &amp; qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus</hi>) offend the ventricle, eſpecially in its mouth, which, conſiſting of of many nerves, is of more accurate ſenſation, and therefore we either mixe benevolent lenocinyes with purgatives, or ſelect, ſuch as are not ſo ingratefull, nor ſo much diſturb the ventricle. Which if they can be procured, muſt not yet be preſently exhibited, ſave by thoſe for whom they are convenient, and in ſuch quantity, as may reſpond to the ſtrength of nature, and be eaſily born.</p>
                        <p>Which quantity is various, according to the various faculties of the Medicaments, which if they be weaker, may be exhibited by ſo much in a greater quantity, if ſtronger in a leſſe. Now I call them purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives weak, which by gentle and benign motion of the ventricle, cleanſe the firſt region of the body, and are meaſured rather by ounces, than drams, as <hi>Mannae,</hi> the pulpe of Tamarinds, the pith of <hi>Caffia,</hi> or the like: Thoſe valid or ſtrong, which being ſmall in quantity produce groat and violent effects, and which are rather weighed by grains and ſoruples, than by drams, of which hereafter: all them are accounted weak, which are meaſured by ounces; and they violent which are meaſured by grains; they indifferent which are
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:37350:103"/>meaſured by drams, as Rhabarb, Senny, Aloes and the like, all which, as alſo all lubricating and roborating purgatives, may be taken in greater quantity.</p>
                        <p>This alſo holds good in alterating Medicaments,
<note place="margin">Alterantium doſis.</note> which by how much they recede leſſe from the ſymmetry of our body, as being onely hot or cold in the firſt degree, may be preſcribed in greater quantity; by how much they recede more, as hot or cold in the fourth degree, may be exhibited in leſſer quantity; it is not then without perill copiouſly to aſſume Pepper, Bartram, Euphorbium, or Cicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta, Hedum or Water-Lillies, becauſe by the former the intralls would be inflamed, by the later benummed and chilled.</p>
                        <p>But ſince roborative Medicaments differ much in their active pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, they muſt be uſed in different quantities, as cordiall waters by ounces, conſerves, roborating the principall parts by drams, more potent Antidotes, by ſcruples; Bezoar-ſtone, and Unicorns horn by grains.</p>
                        <p>Now ſuch liquids as are aſſumed either to roborate, alter, or purge, may be given in a greater quantity.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore not only the efficacy of the Medicament, but alſo the ſtate of the body and humours require an augmentation,
<note place="margin">Qui Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentis vaitdis, qui benignis e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent.</note> or diminuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in quantity; a gentle and weak Medicament will not move a ſtrong and firme body, which hath been either accuſtomed to labour, and frequent purgation, or peſtered with many obſtructions; whereas the ſoft and ſlender bodyes of women and children, which are either dry or macilent, as alſo of pregnant women and perſons newly recovered from diſeaſes, will not endure ſtrong ones.</p>
                        <p>The ſpecies alſo, and plenty of the humour,
<note place="margin">Frigidus &amp; craſſus humor tardius purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur.</note> varyes the quantity of the Medicament; for a viſcid, groſſe, frigid, Melanchollicke, pitui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous and tenaciouſly adhering humour will hardly be deduced, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires a more valid and potent catharticke for its excluſion, a thin, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid, and chollerick humour will ſometimes be ejected by ſpontaneous vomit, very eaſily by a purgative Medicament.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, the ſtate of the heavens, the nature of the region, and the condition of the ſeaſon of the year require a different quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Medicament, for ſeeing the belly is obdurate in a cold ſeaſon, (<hi>Aphor.</hi> 5. <hi>lib.</hi> 3) and a rigid Winter coartactes, and condenſes the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, eſpecially in the frigid region or climate, the humour then tena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly adhering, is not propelled, ſave either by a ſtrong Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment once, or a gentle one often and in abundance exhibited, and as the year for the moſt part cauſes diſeaſes according to its own conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution (<hi>Aphor.</hi> 5. <hi>lib.</hi> 3.) ſo according to the ſpecies of the humour cauſing the diſeaſe, and its greater or leſſer progreſſe: it is requiſite, that not only the kind, but quantity of the Medicament be changed, which muſt be more copious: if by reaſon of the body, humour, ſtate of the heavens, region, or cuſtome purgation be difficult, as on the contrary, if purgation be eaſy in leſſer quantity, as ſhall appear hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>

                        <p>FEW Compounds are found to confiſt of many Simples equal in proportion, but two or more exceed the quantity of the reſt. They exceed, which are the matters Vicegerents, and induce an apt form to the Medicaments, as Oil, Wax, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thargy, in Salves and Unguents; or which are moſt potent in action, and conſtitute the baſis in compoſition, as Aloes in many Pills; as alſo ſuch as have but weak faculties in great quantity, or are adhibited for the preſervation of others, as Honey and Sugar in Electuaries and Syrups.</p>
                        <p>This rule is chiefly to be obſerved in the proportion of Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to be compounded, that that which brings more utility to the Medicament, ſhould be adhibited in greater quantity in compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                        <p>They which are ſymbolical, whoſe matter is equally apt to induce the form of the Medicament, and which are in their faculties equally averſe to the cauſe and ſymptome of the part affected, ſhould be mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in equal weight: which ſeems to be obſerved in the Tetraphar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macal Unguent, which conſiſts of equal portions of Wax, Roſine, Pitch, and Bulls fat.

                        <p>Some portion of ſimple Medicaments is meaſured by number, ſome by weight, others by both; ſome in meaſures, ſome in hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulls, others in pugils.</p>
                        <p>The quantity of roots are variouſly meaſured for their doſis, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their various virtue and efficacy in operation. If their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty gently move the belly, they are meaſured by drams; if potent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by ſcruples; if they onely alter, by whole or half ounces; and when they make up a bath, by pounds or handfulls.</p>
                        <p>In making Syrups of a great quantity, they may be exhibited from ℥. j. to ℥. ij. or ℥. iij. in decoctions for one doſis, from <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>. ij. to ℥. ſs. or ℥. j. or more or leſs, according to the power of the roots. If the decoction be made for many doſes, their quantity muſt be proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately augmented.</p>
                        <p>When two, three, or more roots of the ſame, or very like quality are preſcribed, a leſſer quantity of each ſhould be taken, that all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd may make up the quantity of one, according to <hi>Rondolet.</hi> Which ſhould alſo be obſerved in all other Simples that are ſimilar in quality, if ſo be they equally conduce to the propugnating of one affection, and roborating one part.

                        <p>THat we might dilucidly explicate the accurate compoſition of Medicaments, we have largely diſcuſſed the manner of their confection, their baſis, form, end, and quantity of every Ingredient, as alſo the reaſon of their equality or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equality. Now it reſts, that the Medicaments thus compoſed be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in ſuch places as may conduce to the preſervation of their vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues integral.</p>
                        <p>Now a Medicament, whether ſimple or compound, (for both muſt be kept) muſt not be repoſed in any but in a fit and convenient place, that it be not altered and corrupted, but kept in its perfect vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour till opportunity cauſes its delivery to ſuch as it fits.</p>
                        <p>A Simple muſt firſt be ſelected, and purged from filth, and its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crementitious and uſeleſs parts, and then dryed, that it may be kept; for humid things will not keep without moulding and putrefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
                        <p>Herbs muſt be dryed in a ſhade,
<note place="margin">Herbarum re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitio.</note> or a place where the Sun ſcorches net, yet not marcid, but dry, and voyd of fumes and duſt, and then bound in little bundles, muſt be repoſed in canvaſs or paper bags, leſt they take detriment by the aforeſaid cumbrances. Flowers muſt alſo be thus dryed, repoſed, and ſo conſerved. Now Conſervation and Repoſition are related.</p>
                        <p>Dry and groſs herbs take no harm from the rigour of cold, but liquid and humid are caſily condenſed; which appropinquating to heat, are thereby brought to their priſtine ſtate. Yet diſtilled waters by immoderate congelation loſe much of their bonity, and are often effuſed by the abruption of the glaſſes wherein they are repoſed through the vehemency of cold, unleſs the Confectioners care pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent it.</p>

<pb n="146" facs="tcp:37350:106"/>that it broke all my earthen, glaſs, tin, and copper veſſels, (though very ſtrong) wherein I had put the waters: And when bread was drawn hot from the oven, it preſently acquired a ſtony obdurateneſs; neither were the wine-cellars free from froſt. And when the vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency of the cold aſſwaged, all the houſes in <hi>Lutetia</hi> were white both within and without with horrid ice.

<note place="margin">Seminum.</note> and kept in a dry place.</p>
                        <p>Roots after purgation and are faction are reſerved in wooden Boxes or Cheſts,

                        <p>Juices are alſo repoſed in wooden Boxes, or glaſs or earthen Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, as alſo Water-drops, Gums, whole or parts of Animals and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals.</p>
                        <p>Liquors,

                        <p>Compound Medicaments, according to their different conſiſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and virtues, require for their Cepoſitories different Veſſels, as Hydromel, a Barrel; Syrups, Potters veſſels, and for carriage ſake Boxes of white Iron or Tin; as the Syrup of Mompelian Maiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hair, which repoſed in ſuch a veſſel, may be commodiouſly conveyed to exotick regions; ſolid Electuaries, wooden Boxes; liquid ones, tin or earthen Veſſels well leaded; Powders, glaſs; Unguents, tin pots.

                        <p>Many for their conſervation muſt be condited with Vinegar, Salt, or both, as Cucumbers, Capers, Olives; or with Sugar or Honey, as all kinde of Medicaments, whereof Electuaries or Syrups are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed.</p>
                        <p>Decoctions will keep in Summer two or three dayes, in Winter a whole week; diſtilled Waters and Conſerves, a whole year.</p>
                        <p>Syrups perfectly cocted, Electuaries; Trochisks, Pills, Oils, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guents, and Salves, will often keep two years; as alſo Roots, Woods, Barks, dry Juices, Tears and Gums, three years, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times four; Elateries, thirty years; Nails, Bones, Horns, an age.</p>
                        <p>Some can ſcarce be long preſerved without the preſence of thoſe things with which they hold familiarity, as the Magnet with Iron, with whoſe limature it is nouriſhed, and upon whoſe abſence it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayes, and loſes its vigour.</p>
                        <p>Others better preſerve their faculties, if by the appropinquation of other things they be vindicated from the injury of the air and worms. Thus Camphyre buried in Linſeed is ſafely kept, Limmons and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranges in a heap of Wheat will not ſo ſoon putrefy; and Mechoa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cams root involved in Wormwood keeps its faculties entire, and will not be ſo eaſily croded.</p>
                        <p>Musk and Civet are ſafely conſerved in lead boxes: but that they ſhould reſartiate their loſt virtue by ſuſpenſion in the middle of a Bog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe,

                        <p>Medicaments therefore, as well ſimple as compound, if they be thus ſedulouſly conſerved, will endure long; if not, they ſoon fade and decay.</p>
                        <p>But the greateſt part of theſe ſhould be changed every year; yet if any change not their colour, odour, and ſapour, they need not. Now thoſe keep longeſt which are of a groſs ſubſtantiality, and whoſe qualities tenaciouſly and firmly adhere to their ſubſtances; as on the contrary, thoſe do not endure long whoſe ſubſtance is rare, as Flowers, and thoſe whoſe virtues are ſuperficial and diſſipable. Yet thoſe are kept better and longer which are included in cloſe Boxes, or Veſſels well operculated, for ſo their virtue is retained more ſecurely.

                        </head>
                        <p>MAny Simples of ſeveral kinds have ſymbolical qualities; and yet Experience hath demonſtrated, that ſome of them excell others, and are more convenient for the profliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of diſeaſes, as being endued with a better altering, roborating, or purging faculty, and exhibiting more ſucceſsfull ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects; of which are ſome Plants, or parts thereof, and ſome Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, which being abſolutely deſcribed, put the Apothecary upon doubts,
<note place="margin">Radices aperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entes majores.</note> who is ignorant of the genuine dilucidation: whoſe tenuity, that we may auxiliate, we will give him the names of the five opening roots;
<note place="margin">Radices aperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive majores.</note> and they are the roots of Smallage, Sperage, Parſley, Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, and Butchers-broom. Beſides which, other five are much cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated, to wit, the roots of Graſs, the greater Madder, Oenone, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, and <hi>Eryngium.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The four greater or colder ſeeds are the ſeeds of Limons,
<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Semina frigida</hi> 4. <hi>majora.</hi>
                           </note> Gourds, Melons, and Cucumbers; the four leſſer, of Lettices, Purſlain, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dive and Succory.</p>
                        <p>The four greater or hotter ſeeds,
<note place="margin">Semina calida majora, &amp; totidem mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nora.</note> are of Aniſe, Fennel, Cummin, and Carraway; the four leſs hot, of <hi>Ameos,</hi> our Ladies Roſe, Smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage, Carret.</p>
                        <p>Cordial flowers are onely three,
<note place="margin">Cordiales tres.</note> to wit, of Violets, Bugloſs, and Borrage; which if they be ſuch, are then moſt effectual, when re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and retentive of their colour and odour; for when they are dry, inſipid, and inodorous, they have either quite loſt, or much weakned their qualities.</p>
                        <p>And indeed the qualities of all flowers periſh with their odour, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour, and colour.</p>
                        <p>But I am of opinion, that Roſes, which of all flowers retain their ſuavity longeſt, as alſo all ſuch as by their gratious odour exhilarate the ſpirits, are moſt cordial; for all ſuaveolent flowers, whether her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal, as the Lilly of the Valley; or arbuſtal or arboral, as the flowers of Orange trees are cordial, and may with ſucceſs be uſed in medici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary buſineſs.</p>
                        <p>The flowers of Chamemile, Melilote, and Aniſe, are accounted cordial: but I prefer as more excellent, the flowers of Oranges, Jaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, Deluce, Sage, Roſemary, Betony, Clove-gilliflowers, and many others, which with their fragrancy delight the noſe, and recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate the ſpirits.</p>
                        <p>The hairs or capillary herbs are five,
<note place="margin">Herbe capilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res quinque.</note> Maidens-hair, commonly
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:37350:108"/>called Mompienſian hair, common <hi>Adiantium, Polytricum,</hi> Citrarch, or Wall-fern, Rue on the wall, without all reaſon called <hi>Salvia vitae,</hi> to which we may adde <hi>Epithymum</hi> and Woodbind.</p>
                        <p>The common mollifying herbs are four, Mallows, Marſh-mallows,
<note place="margin">Emmollientes berbae octo.</note> black Violet, Garden Bear-foot, or brank Urſine; whereunto four more are adjoyned, Mercury, Pelitory of the wall, Beet, and Arache, all which are uſed in making the decoction of Clyſters, and laxative Cataplaſms.</p>
                        <p>There are many pretious Fragments,
<note place="margin">Fragmentae pretioſa quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que.</note> but five artificially in uſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Phyſicians, as of Saphire, Granate, Emerald, Hyacinth, Sardis.</p>
                        <p>The Vulgar know onely four kinds of Cordial Waters, and cannot be perſwaded to a fifth, to wit, of Endive, Succory, Bugloſs, and Borrage: but I finde eight beſides theſe that are more cordial, to wit, the Water of Carduus, Scabioſe, Marigold, Devils bit, Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorrel, Goats-beard, Sorrel, and Water-lillyes.</p>
                        <p>Some conduce to the roboration of the brain,
<note place="margin">Quatuor aquae cephalicae.</note> and are therefore called Cephalical Waters, which are four, to wit, the Water of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony, Balm, Roſes, and Orange tree flowers.</p>
                        <p>There are alſo in Shops four hot Unguents, as <hi>Ung. Aregon,
<note place="margin">Quatuor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guenta calida, &amp; quatuor frigida.</note> Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiatum, Altheae,</hi> and <hi>Agrippae;</hi> and as many frigid ones, to wit, <hi>Ung. Album, Roſatum, Populeum, Citrinum.</hi>

                        <p>The ſame Law muſt be obſerved in compounds but not ſo ſtrictly, for powder muſt be put for powder, eclegme for eclegme, electuary for electuary, ſyrup for ſyrup: Yet there is often ſuch affinity in qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity betwixt Medicaments of different conſiſtencies, that a ſubſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may be eaſily admitted. For if any hath an averſation to a bechi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call eclegme, he may without danger aſſume ſyrup of jujubs, and he that refuſes pills, why may he not aſſume ſome other catharticke of equall vertue in a potion? Thus Phyſicians do oft indulge their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients, by preſcribing liquids to ſuch as nauſeate ſolids, and on the contrary.</p>
                        <p>Yet a ſimple Medicament is not always ſubſtituted for a ſimple one, for ſince one can ſcarce find two ſimples alike in all things: for the want of one, to which no ſingle one reſponds, we ſubſtitute two or more, whoſe concourſe exhibite the ſimilar vertues, whether in elementary qualities, as heat, cold, humiditie, and ſiccitie, or in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundary qualities, which follow the modification of the matter: For it is enough, if the ſubſtituted Medicament effect that, which the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine and deficient promiſed. For one that wants a rare and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Medicament calefying or refrigerating in the ſeoend degree, and hath other two, the one hot or cold in the third degree, the other in the firſt; may by putting theſe two together, acquire one accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date to his purpoſe, to wit calefying or refrigerating in the ſecond re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, which rule is of uſe in mixing attenuating, incraſſating and other ſimples.</p>
                        <p>But becauſe the ſoile and the heavens change the qualities of ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, as we have obſerved in the Perſian tree; we muſt with dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence obſerve which are fitteſt for ſubſtitution, for there is much dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betwixt our flower deluce, and that of Florence: for their is Cephalicall, and Bechicall, our Phlegmagogous and ſtrongly purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. And as Canary wine is more noble than Spaniſh, and Spaniſh than French wine: ſo the grapes from which they are expreſſed, are of diſtinct qualities, ſapours and degrees of heat: and therefore ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the ſame kind and ſpecies have not alwayes got the ſame tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature and degree of qualities, for what growes in a hotter ſoil is hotter: and in a colder colder.</p>
                        <p>When therefore a Medicament, is preſcribed, which becauſe of its ſoil is hotter,
<note place="margin">Quamado gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>du tertio aut quarto cali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum ſubſtitui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur pro minus calids.</note> and cannot be got, another of the ſame kind may be ſubſtituted, through the colder, if in greater quantity.</p>
                        <p>For that which is hot in the fourth degree may be taken in ſuch a quantity, as it may only calefie in the third degree; as for example, if you take but about four grains of Euphorbium, it will calefy onely in the third degree, which in greater quantitie would calefy in the fourth; and by how much you take leſſe, by ſo much it calefies leſſe; but every Medicament hath a determinate doſis, elſe ſo ſmall a por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion might be given, that though it were fire, yet would it neither burn nor calefie; and Cloves, which are hot in the third degree, if leſſe than three grains of them be adminiſtred, they calefy not
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:37350:109"/>to the third degree, and ſo of all qualities in their degrees.</p>
                        <p>Now there are in every degree three parts or manſions,
<note place="margin">Cujuſ<expan>
                                 <am>

                                 </am>
                                 <ex>que</ex>
                              </expan> gradus tres partes.</note> begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, middle and end, which are ſo conſtituted, that the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of one degree coincidates with the end of another, as the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the fourth with the end of the fift. So the end of Winter differs little from the beginning of the ſpring.</p>
                        <p>The uſuall doſis of ſuch as calefy in the fourth degree is of four grains, whereof there being three manſions;
<note place="margin">Doſis callido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum in quarto gradu.</note> the chief doſis which attains the end of that ſame grade, is of twelve grains: that which attains the middle, ſixteen, and the beginning, twenty grains, which is the doſis of ſuch as calefy in the end of the third degree.</p>
                        <p>Wherefore when any want a Medicament, that califies or frigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies in the end of the firſt degree, he may ſubſtitute one that is calld or frigid in the beginning of the ſecond degree; he that wants a medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cament hot in the end of the ſecond degree, may exhibit one thats hot in the beginning of the third.</p>
                        <p>Now ſince the doſes of compounds are deduced from ſimples, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the deficiency of any ſimple, another may be ſubſtituted which is Analogicall to the deficient, in the mixtion whereof, if the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid Lawes be obſerved, the reſult in the compound will be no way deficient by ſubſtitution.</p>

For its abſurd to call thoſe ſuccedaneous Vicegerents, which are mdued with oppoſite not ſuccedaneous and ſymbolicall qualities, and they write without reaſon, who ſubſtitute <hi>Euphorbium</hi> for Agarick, Pellitory for Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, and Melliote for a Quince, for theſe have no affinity with each other.</p>

                        <p>But when ſome weaker are ſubſtituted in place of better, their qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities muſt be augmented by quantity, for quantity reduplicated re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenſes the weakneſs of the quality, as on the contrary, if the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute be too valid, leſſe quantity muſt be exhibited, that thereby its rigour may be diminiſhed.</p>
                        <p>Now, this ſhould not be done without the advice of ſome skilfull Doctor, which many do not onely deſpiſe, but themſelves preſcribe Medicaments to the great damage of their patients, but ſuch are for the moſt part unconſtant, importunate, and talkative knaves, who trimly apparelled intrude themſelves to the ſicks preſence, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them with fair ſpeeches. I ſpeake of that impious rabble, who deceive the incautious vulgar; but the skilfull and prudent, who take nothing raſhly, but at a Phiſicians advice and preception, may ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute, legitimate Vicegerents in the place of ſuch as want or are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed.</p>
                        <p>Thoſe that without choice and care repoſe for genuine and good, what ever Medicament comes firſt to their hands, will make dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Medicaments, and ſubſtitutions.</p>

                        <p>Theſe I thought meet to detect, leaſt ſome unskilfull Apothecary be deceived by ſuch circumforaneous preſtigiatours, who often ſell the flowers of Carthamus for Crocus, and Ivory for Monocerots horn; and ſimilate many more, eſpecially rare and precious Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caments, whoſe uſe is frequent, and vertues eximious.</p>
                        <p>Leaſt therefore the Apothecary, in whoſe hand the life or death of a patient is, be imprudently circumduced by theſe wicked ſlaves, for lucres ſake, to circumvent the patient, Ile ſhew him how to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect and avoid theſe impious frauds and deceits.</p>

                           </head>
                           <p>Sometimes the ſubſtance alone, ſometimes the juice, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the decoction of the Medicament is adminiſtred, which decoction, that it may be more eaſily and ſucceſſefully aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, muſt be of ſimple, diſtilled, or other convenient water, or hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, as the intention of the Phyſician and exigency of the matter requires. Now the liquor, wherein the decoction is made that muſt be aſſumed at the mouth (of which alone we now ſpeak) ſhould be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with no inſuave, or violent quality. For potulent decoctions made in the juice of Wormewood, leſſer Centory, immature grapes, or Lee, or vinegar, are neither ſafe, nor gratefull: but unguents, Pills Fotus, and whatever is extrinſecally applicable, that requires decoctions to their preparations, may be decocted in any convenient humour, whether bitter, acerb, ſalty, or oyly, if the condition of the diſeaſe or part affected poſtulate it.</p>
                           <p>But now we treat of that more ſpeciall decoction,
<note place="margin">Quarum deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionum fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quens uſus.</note> which after per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colation, is aſſumed by the mouth, either alone or mixed, with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Medicaments diſſolved; of which ſort, is the common decocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of any Medicament, and the pectorall decoction, which no Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dick can well be without.</p>
                           <p>Now every decoction is either ſmall, or much, or indifferent, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſubſtance and ſtrength of the Medicament, which is to
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:37350:114"/>be cocted;
<note place="margin">Quae parum aut multum de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coqucnda.</note> for ſome muſt be decocted gently, as having a rare ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and weak and diſſipable faculties; others will ſuſtain a more valid decoction, as conſiſting of a firm, craſs, and denſe ſubſtance, and endued with faculties not ſo diſſoluble; others require a mode rate decoction, whoſe ſubſtance and faculties are of a mean con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency: thus Fruits would not be ſo little, nor Flowers ſo much cocted as Roots.</p>
                           <p>When a Decoction is preſcribed abſolutely, without the ſpecial deſignation of any liquor,
<note place="margin">Aquae quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas in decoctis parandis.</note> it ought to be made either in pure and ſimple water, as fountain or river water, or elſe in rain water; the quantity whereof muſt reſpond to the quantity of the Simples to be cocted, as near as may be, without exuberance or defect; for when Simples through coction depoſe their qualities into the water, if it be copious, and they few, the decoction after percolation will retain be weak faculties: As on the contrary, if many Simples be cocted in little water, the decoction will be exhaled and diſſipated, and the Simples burned rather than brought to elixation; which is acquired by moderate heat in an humour proportionate to the quantity and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the thing cocted.</p>
                           <p>Thoſe that ſuſtain the longeſt coction, require more abundance of water, the ſhorter the leſs, many Simples require much: ſo that thoſe that are hard, and require long coction, ſhould be demerged in water, and covered two or three fingers therein. Thus a certain meaſure of water cannot be defined, but is often left to the Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caries judgement.</p>
                           <p>When a Decoction is to be made onely for one doſis,
<note place="margin">Aquae quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas pro doſi pa randa.</note> it's enough to elixate a few Simples in half a pound of water on a ſlow fire, till it be boyled to half; if for two doſis, then in a whole pound of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; if for four, in two pounds. And thus may the quantity of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be augmented, as the Simples are augmented.</p>
                           <p>There are furthermore three Decoctions very uſual in making Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines. The firſt is called the common Decoction, which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly uſed to the diſſolution of Purgatives, ſometimes to the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Senny leaves, and ſometimes to the infuſion of Simples.</p>
                           <p>The ſecond is commonly called the pectoral Decoction, becauſe it is uſed to all ſuch as bring adjument to the pectoral parts. The third is the glyſteral Decoction; of which in its place.</p>
                           <p>All men do not deſcribe their Confections alike, but every one adds or detracts ſomething according to his judgement. This is the moſt vulgar and uſual deſcription of the common Decoction.</p>

                           <p>THat certain and convenient quantity of any Medicament, which is preſcribed, or rather given to a ſick man at once, or neceſſity compelling at twice, is a Doſis: for Doſis is Dation; whereof there are as many varieties, as there are differences in the nature or properties of Medicaments, or Bodyes to which the Medicaments are offered.
<note place="margin">Doſis medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentorum va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria.</note> For there is one Doſis of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quids, another of Solids, and another of thoſe that have a middle conſiſtency. Catharticks alſo are given in various Doſes, which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving once entred into the body, if they be too valid, or exhibited in too great meaſure, do not onely exagitate the ſuperfluous humours, but alſo the good and laudable, and by griping the bowels, hurt the faculties there inhering. One Doſis alſo is given to children, another to young men, another to men of ſtrength, another to old men, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their ſeveral natures, cuſtomes, and ſtrength. The Doſis of Liquids is meaſured and given in ounces; of Solids, ſometimes in grains, often in drams, and ſometimes in ounces.</p>
                           <p>Altering Medicaments are ſeldome given by one ounce alone,
<note place="margin">Alterantium medicamento<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum doſis.</note> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it be to children, or elſe that they be endued with eximious and valid qualities, as <hi>Aqua vitae,</hi> Cinamon, and thoſe we call Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial.</p>
                           <p>Their more uſual Doſis conſiſts of three or four ounces; if they be exhibited in greater meaſure, they cauſe loathings, they ſubvert the ventricle, and are inſucceſsfully excluded by vomit.</p>
                           <p>Roboratives, eſpecially liquid ones,
<note place="margin">Roborantium doſis.</note> are given from one ounce to three or four; ſolid ones are ſometimes given by grains, as the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of <hi>Monoceros;</hi> ſometimes by ſcruples and drams, as Cordial Confections, and many Antidotes.</p>
                           <p>Purgatives are meaſured and given after the ſame manner,
<note place="margin">Purgantium.</note> ſome by
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:37350:115"/>three, ſix, or eight grains, as <hi>Diacrydion,</hi> and <hi>Stibium</hi> alſo, which though it be immite and effrenous, yet tamed and caſtigated by Art, and exhibited by a prudent Phyſician, often produces ſucceſsfull ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects: And I ſee no reaſon why it may not be uſed in ſtead of bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to the cure of a contumacious diſeaſe.</p>
                           <p>For if it be lawfull for mans ſubſidy to ſeek remedies from Vipers fleſh,
<note place="margin">Neotericorum in inveniendis remediis ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litas.</note> and their very skin and excrements, how can it be illegitimate to expect ſolace from thoſe Medicaments, which Neotericks ſedulity have invented, their induſtrious dexterity have ſecured, and many experiences have proved; though the Antients either were ignorant of them, neglected them, or adminiſtred them unduely, as now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes many malevolent Circulators, who kill innumerable with their <hi>Stibium</hi> that is ill prepared, and exhibited in an undue doſis, neither when, nor to whom it is meet.</p>
                           <p>And that I may return to my purpoſe;
<note place="margin">Quam varia catharticorum doſis.</note> ſome Catharticks are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven onely in a ſmall doſis, as <hi>Colocynthis,</hi> and Hellebor, by a few grains or ſcruples; others by drams, as <hi>Rheum;</hi> others by ounces, as Manna, Caſſia, Tamarinds.</p>
                           <p>A Doſis then denotes a quantity of a Medicament fit to be exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited at once; as when any Medicament of three or four ounces at the moſt is made into the form of a potion, Decoction, or diſtilled; wherein we dilute Roboratives, as Powders, Antidotes, and Cordial Confections; or infuſe Catharticks, as Agarick; or diſſolve them, as <hi>Catholicon</hi> or <hi>Diacarthamum;</hi> whereof every one hath its peculiar doſis, whereby it ſhould be given in greater or leſſer quantity, as it is of weak or valid faculties.

<note place="margin">Purgantia cur in forma pota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bili convenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiora.</note> and provoke monthly flowers and urine, is liquid.

For one dram of a ſolid Medicament diluted with ſome humour,
<note place="margin">Catharticum liquidum citius ducit.</note> will move the belly more than twice as much of it whole. Wherefore when we ſay a purgative Medicament abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely, we mean a laxative Potion, whoſe doſis ſhould ſeldome exceed three ounces, leſt by moving the ventricle, it be preſently excluded by vomit.</p>

                           <p>And of each of theſe, whether ſimple or compound, are made purgative Potions, when they are macerated, infuſed, diſſolved, or cocted in ſome fit liquor; as to educe Choler, thus:</p>

                           </head>
                           <p>THE acception of Julep and Syrup with the Arabians is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt one and the ſame, for they confound them together, and ſpeak of them under the ſame head or Chapter, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding nothing more by an abſolute Julep, than Sugar diſſolved in Roſe water, and cocted to the conſiſtency of a Syrup. But we ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more diſtinctly, treat of them both, but in ſeveral Chapters and Books, to wit, of Syrups, which ſhould be inſpiſſated by a longer coction in our Officine: but of Juleps, which ſhould be but lightly cocted, and preſently aſſumed, in this our Book of Medicinal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts.</p>
                           <p>Now Julep is a Perſian word,
<note place="margin">Julep quid.</note> ſignifying a ſweet Potion, which the Greeks call <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap>; and they make it of any diſtilled dulcorate water, as of Syrups of the juice or decoction of Simples, elixated with Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar or Honey to a more craſs conſiſtency.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Serapio,</hi> that he might eſchew the inſuavity of all odour and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour, confected a Julep, or rather <hi>Hydroſacharum,</hi> of Water and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar onely, which he calls a ſimple Syrup. <hi>Avicenna,</hi> to conciliate more ſuavity, adds thereto a third part of Roſe-water. <hi>Meſue</hi> takes not onely water, but confects Juleps of juices, infuſions, and deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. And the vulgarity of men call all limpid dulcorate Potions Julens, whether they be made of diſtilled waters onely, or of the decoction of a few ſweet ſimples, and much water percolated, clari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
<note place="margin">Julepus zizy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorum.</note> and dulcorated; ſuch as the Julep, or rather Syrup of Jujubs; for when it is made of a hundred great Jujubs, and four pounds of water cocted to the half, and one pound of ſugar, it acquires a more craſs conſiſtency than a Julep; and therefore when it comes to be u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, it requires dilution in ſimple water cocted, or in a Priſane, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as a Julep is limnid enough of it ſelf. And that ſame Syrup, which
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:37350:116"/>from its frequent uſe there; derives its name from <hi>Alexandria,</hi>
                              <note place="margin">Syrupus Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andrinus.</note> is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly called a Julep, ſince it is as much inſpiſſiated by coction, and as long kept as any Syrup.</p>
                           <p>Now the Julep of Roſes is right made, when it conſiſts of Roſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water, with half as much Sugar cocted almoſt to the craſſitude of a Syrup, or little leſs, if it be preſently to be aſſumed, as vulgar Juleps,
<note place="margin">Julepus roſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus qui fiat.</note> which are made for preſent uſe, of Sugar, or ſome Syrup, with thrice its quantity of water: as,</p>
                           <p>℞. <hi>The water of Endive,</hi> ℥. <hi>iij. Syrup of Limons,</hi> ℥. <hi>j. mingle them.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Thus Juleps ſhould be of a more liquid conſiſtency, that they may be percolated: but thoſe that are longer cocted, or receive onely a double quantity of Water to their Sugar, as the ſyrup of Roſes,
<note place="margin">
                                 <hi>Syrupus Roſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reus</hi> Rondele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tii.</note> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Rondeletius,</hi> or an equal weight of both, according to <hi>Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius;</hi> are becauſe of their craſſitude ſcarce fluid, and admit not of percolation.</p>
                           <p>Therefore according to the different coction and quantity of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the Sugar, it will be a Syrup, if both be equal; or a Julep, if three parts of Water be put to one of Sugar, according to <hi>Loubertus.</hi>
                           </p>

                           <p>ALL analeptical and reſtorative Medicaments, which refocillate the habit of the body abſumed by long diſeaſe or hunger, which are preſcribed to reſartiate the vigour of the faculties weakned with languor, are not onely taken from medicinal, but ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental matter. For whereas they conduce partly to the nutriment of the body, and partly to the cure of the part affected, it is manifeſt by reaſon, that they ſhould be endued with various qualities.</p>
                           <p>Now they are called diſtilled Medicaments,
<note place="margin">Diſtillata cur dicta.</note> becauſe they are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilled drop by drop from an Alembick into a ſubjected Veſſel; and Reſtoratives, becauſe they are extracted from nutritive fleſh, from Conſerves, Cordial Powders, and all ſuch things as either by their odour or ſubſtance refreſh the ſpirits, or roborate the principal parts.</p>

                           <p>ALmonds are either bitter, which are ſolely Medicinall, or ſweet, which are partly alimentall, partly Medicamentall.

                           <p>THE head aggravated with excrementitious humours, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially with phlegme, may, be emptied with many kindes of Medicaments, but none can effect this without the moleſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of other parts; for phlegmagogous potions or pills, while they educe Phlegme from the brain, do importunately moleſt the ventricle and members adjoyning, and by moving the belly cauſe grievous pains, and very often excite heart aches and ſwoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings;
<note place="margin">Apophlegmatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morum utili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas.</note> but Apophlegmatiſmes, being indued with a ſapour not ſo ungratefull, affects the concavity of the mouth more gently, atract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing abundance of Phlegme through the emiſſaryes of the palate from the brain, which may be eaſily excluded by frequent ſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Now all ſimples, whereon Apophlegmatiſmes conſiſt, are hot, and often indued with acrimony, whereby they do not onely atte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate, incide, and attract the cold humour, but alſo excite the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſive faculty to its worke.</p>
                           <p>Theſe things project Phlegme, Maſtick chewed, or made into a gargariſme, ſage, ſtaveſacre, thyme, penny-royall, carthamus, pep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, muſtard, bartram, ginger, acorus, the roots of deluce, and Cyperus, whereof ſome cut into ſmall pieces are maſticated and grinded with the teeth, or pulverated, and put into ſome conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient liquour, and ſo formed into pills or trochiskes; or obvolved in ſome thin cloath, and made up like a knot: or elixated, and their decoction percolated and kept in ones mouth, like a gargariſme.</p>
                           <p>Their more uſuall forme is ſolid, that they may be longer detai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the mouth, and maſticated whence a maſticatory is uſed for an Apophlegmatiſme and an apothegmatiſme for a maſticatory: the head muſt decline while the Medicament is maſticated or chewed, and the lips be open, that the humour attracted and congeſted may have more free and ſpeedy paſſage.</p>

<note place="margin">Bolus quid.</note> ſo that a Bolus is a piece of a purgative Medicament of the conſiſtency of an opiate, fit for ingeſtion, and of ſuch craſſitude, as it may be eaſily ſwallowed whole, ſome of the Latins call it <hi>Buccea.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>It may be made of any kind of purgative,

                           <p>Sometimes alteratives, and Aromaticall ſimples are mixed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to correct the effcrous nature of the purgatives, or to conci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liate a more gratefull odour, and ſapour, or to helpe to the robora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſome part, but yet in ſmall quantity, leaſt the bulk of the bolus ſwell too much, which the ſick do much abhor,

                           <p>Many bechicall and ſweet ingredients go to this confection, as ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, piſtack-nutts, pine-kernells, and other ſweet fruits, which brayed, and accurately ſubacted with ſimple, or roſe-water, become a maſſe, whereof wafers or morſells,

                           <p>GLyſter, or <hi>Clyſmus,</hi> is a word borrowed from the Greeks, ſignifying ablution, as <hi>Enema</hi> injection; and both are uſed for the ſame thing: for ablution cannot be in the belly, but by injection of ſome thing, which by the fundament is immit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the inteſtines to excite the excretive faculty to mollify the bardneſs of the belly, to alter the intemperature, to eaſe the dolour, to diſcuſs the flatuoſity, to cohibit the fluour, and kill and expell the worms in the inteſtines.</p>
                           <p>Glyſters are inſtituted for many more effects alſo;

                           <p>Now the <hi>Uterus</hi> hath its proper Glyſters, which muſt be infunded into its fundament by a <hi>Metrenchyta,</hi> the bladder its Glyſters; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther want the bowels theirs, whoſe orifice is narrow and nervous, and their cavity profound.</p>
                           <p>And it is taken for a liquid Medicament infuſed into the inteſtines by the fundament, whereof there are various deſcriptions, according to the variety of the affections for which they are ordained; as to mollify the belly, after this manner.</p>

                           <p>And better to excite the drowſy faculty, ſomething of common Salt, or pretious, may be added,

                           <p>AN Hypocauſt is a place made like a little Fornace,
<note place="margin">Hypocaustum quid.</note> wherein ſweat is procured, by dry heat aſcending through, like Spira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, from the fire ſet under it. It is called by another name, to wit,
<note place="margin">Unde dicatur Laconicum. Ejus uſus.</note> 
                              <hi>Laconicum,</hi> becauſe the Laconians chiefly uſed it, as the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes did baths. It conduces much in frigid and diuturnal diſeaſes; for ſeeing its fervid and ſharp heat doth not onely calefy the external habit of the body, but the very <hi>praecordia</hi> and internals alſo; it po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tently opens the paſſages, calefies, melts, and by ſweat educes the humours.</p>
                           <p>But ſeeing this external calour continually thus occurring and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuating it ſelf into the internals, doth ſpeedily project the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, it can ſcarce be tolerated one quarter of an hour without diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipation of the ſpirits, and loſs of ſtrength, whereupon ſwoundings often follow: but the more delicate, and ſuch alſo whoſe bodyes are loaden with impure excrements, are chiefly in danger of this delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quency.
<note place="margin">Quae ingreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum bypocauſti praecedere de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent.</note> He therefore that conſults his ſanity, ſhould never enter theſe Sudatories till he have by purge and phlebotomy, if need be, exonerated his body; for ſo the reliques of thoſe humours that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt his body, may be eaſily projected by ſudour.</p>
                           <p>The Ruſticks cuſtome is irreproveable, who being deſtitute of an Hypocauſt extracted by due and artificial induſtry, take a Hogſhead of a juſt magnitude, and calefy it either by a fire, or by ſetting it over a pan full of burned coals, or a veſſel full of hot water, and ſet there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, ſweating profuſely, and with caſe, without any danger of ſwour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</p>
                           <p>Some will ſit in an oven where bread is but lately drawn out, put their heads onely out at the mouth thereof, and ſo ſweat abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly.</p>

                           <p>Chirurgions have invented a certain Aeſtuary of a vimineous tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, like a Bird-cage, wherein they excite ſuch to ſweat as are infeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the French diſeaſe; which they properly call a Cage, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Birds do not nouriſh, but are nouriſhed.</p>
                           <p>Theſe miſerable Wretches are included herein with hot bricks, and almoſt ſuffocated, till they ſweat abundantly in every part of their bodyes, having before drunk of the Decoction of <hi>Lignum ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum,</hi> or <hi>Sarſaparilla,</hi> or ſome other Alexitery, which will both move ſweat, and deleate the French diſeaſe.</p>

                           <p>BEcauſe there is often mention made of Mucagines, which are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther applyed alone, or mixed with other Medicaments, our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution leads us now to ſpeak a little thereof.</p>
                           <p>Now this Mucilage is efficacious in mollifying, humectating, and leniating ſome dolour, as that ſame which is extracted from gluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous roots and ſeeds; ſometimes it digeſts and attracts, as that ſame which is educed out of many gums. The ſeeds of Line, Foenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greek, Mallows, Quinces, Flea-wort, and Marſh-mallow roots, as alſo their roots macerated in warm water, are very mucaginous. Figs alſo, Gum Arabick, <hi>Tragacanthum,</hi> and Iſinglaſs, if they be a whole night infuſed in water, or other liquor, and the next day re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calefied, and ſtrongly expreſſed through a new cloth or bag, will di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit much mucaginous matter. Thus the mucage of <hi>Bdellium, Saga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penum, Ammoniacum,</hi> and <hi>Galbanum,</hi> is extracted to make up the confection of the mucilaginous Emplaiſter.</p>
                           <p>To every ounce of water, or other liquor, they ordinarily impoſe an ounce of ſeeds, or roots: but if the Mucage ſhould be more craſs, then the quantity of roots or ſeeds muſt be augmented; if more liquid, diminiſhed, as one dram of ſeed to an ounce of water.</p>
                           <p>This Muſlidge applyed to an inflammation, helps much.</p>

                           </head>
                           <p>IT is not enough that a Medicament be accommodated to an affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction onely, but it muſt be fitted to the part affected alſo; for we do not preſcribe one Medicament to the ears, mouth, noſe, and belly, but exhibit a ſingular Medicament to each, as will beſt fit it. The eyes have their peculiar Medicaments, called Collyryes, which are endued with eximious qualities reſpecting their affections eximiouſly; ſuch as <hi>Galen</hi> ſpeaks of, (<hi>libro de oculis, &amp; libris</hi> 4, <hi>&amp;</hi> 5. <hi>compoſit. medicament. loc.</hi>) as alſo <hi>Paulus</hi> and <hi>Aetius</hi> in many places.</p>
                           <p>There are two kinds of Collyryes; the one dry,

                              </gap>, which are by the more recent called Collyries abſolutely, either becauſe by their liquid form they are better accommodated to application, the eyes not tolerating a hard and craſs remedy; or elſe becauſe they are made of dry Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyries, levigated upon a Marble, and diſſolved in water, or ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient liquor. Some of the humid Collyries are of the conſiſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of Honey, or a ſoft Unguent,
<note place="margin">Tuthiae praepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratio.</note> as <hi>Tutia</hi> redacted to the form of an Unguent, by much uſtion and lotion, with the juice of Fennel, or other convenient liquor. Others are altogether liquid and fluxile, as all thoſe which are made of the waters of Eye-bright, Roſes, or Plantain, with a ſmall quantity of white Trochisks.</p>
                           <p>Theſe ſhould be repoſed in glaſs veſſels, as the more ſolid in earthen pots.</p>
                           <p>And as a multitude of ocular affections are cured by Collyries, ſo a multiplicity of materials go to their confecture; as the whole Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of Medicaments, whether of Minerals, Animals, or Plants, from which either Powders can be efringed, or Waters diſtilled, or Juices extracted, or Excrements deſumed.</p>

<note place="margin">Lac virginale cur dicitur.</note> Now it is called Virgins milk, partly from its colour, whereby it is like milk, partly from its conſiſtency and virtues, wherein it is eximious, even to delete the freckles of the skin, which change and adulterate the virgin and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine colour of the face.

For then a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pical, refrigerative Hypnotick applyed to the frontiſpiece of the head, will be very ſalutiferous, by abating the dolour, mitigating the fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, tempering the blood, and cohibiting the aſcendent fumes. <hi>Nicholaus Myrepſius</hi> tells us, that a Frontal duely confected, and
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:37350:137"/>rightly adhibited to the eyes, cures lippitude, and abundant fluours. But we muſt take heed we do not adhibit humectative and refrigera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Frontals to a flegmatick brain, or old men in winter, eſpecially ſeeing they are not meet for ſuch in ſummer,
<note place="margin">Quibus fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talia bene vel male conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unt.</note> nor yet for any of a cold nature. But they may be ſucceſsfully applyed to young men, and ſuch as are cholerick, or infeſted with ſome hot diſeaſe, which alwayes cauſes great dolour in the head at any time.</p>
                           <p>But the uſe of Frontals is no way ſafe for young girls, whoſe <hi>Cranium</hi> yet gapes, and whoſe <hi>Vertex</hi> is yet moveable, eſpecially ſuch as admit Vinegar in their compoſition, which is an enemy to the brain; or are endued with a narcotical, or with a refrigera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory or calefactory quality, or any other eximious faculty in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs.</p>
                           <p>They indeed are very expetible which by the firſt degrees change the diſtemper of the four qualities, cohibit vapours, gently ſoporate the ſenſes, and roborate the brain.</p>
                           <p>All Frontals are either ſomewhat humid, or altogether dry; the humid are of multifarious forms and conſiſtencies, for they are either made in form of an Unguent, or of a Liniment, or of an Opiate, or of a <hi>Cerato malagma;</hi> as when ſome oleaginous Medicaments are ſuper-added to brayed herbs, and a Frontal formed of the mixture.</p>

And he that calls a Cataplaſm thus com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded a Pultis, and a Pultis made of Barley meal, the mucaginous matter of Linſeed, and Eggs yolks, a Cataplaſm, doth erre nothing, according to <hi>Fernelius;</hi> for both have the ſame conſiſtency, to wit, a mean betwixt an Unguent and a Salve; and as it were the reſult of both their materials compounded together, both have the ſame me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod in confecture, and in uſe.</p>

                              <hi>Fernelius</hi> thinks, that the Antients uſed <hi>Cataplaſma</hi> and <hi>Malagms</hi> for the ſame thing: but <hi>Galen,</hi> (<hi>initio lib.</hi> 7. <hi>de comp. med. gen.</hi>) ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the meaning and opinion of the Antients, names thoſe Medicaments alone Malagms, which mollify parts preternaturally obdurated: ſo that a malactical and mollitive Medicament, and a Malagm do not at all differ, nor conſtitute diſtinct ſpecies, as 'tis very probable.</p>
                           <p>Pultiſes then are conſtituted of Roots, Leaves, Stalks cocted to a putrilency, Meal, Fat, and Oil. If dry Plants be required, they muſt be pulverated; if green, cocted till they liquefy, then ſtamped in a mortar, trajected through a ſcarce, and mucaginous fat, or oleagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous matters added to the pulped matter, and ſometimes meal; and then muſt they be again cocted, till they acquire the craſſitude of a Pultis.</p>

                           <p>ASinapiſm is a kinde of Cataplaſm, for their conſiſtency is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, though their faculties be diſtinct: for Sinapiſms conſiſt of one quality, and are alwayes calefactory; Catalpaſms of many; and thence they calefy, refrigerate, mollify, relax, &amp;c. A Sinapiſm is ſeldome or never adhibited in acute diſeaſes, neither by way of table nor colliquament, as <hi>Oribaſius</hi> notes, (<hi>cap.</hi> 13. <hi>lib.</hi> 10.) but in Lethargies, Apoplexies, or the Night-mare, and in ſtupid natures, that the dullneſs of the ſenſe may be excited, the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty awakened, the heat acted, and the humour diſcuſſed.</p>
                           <p>The manner of making a Sinapiſm is thus deſcribed by <hi>Oribaſius</hi> and <hi>Aetius,</hi> (<hi>cap.</hi> 181. <hi>tetr.</hi> 1. <hi>ſerm.</hi> 3.) <hi>Take dryed Figs, q. v. ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerate them a whole day in warm water, afterwards make a ſtrong Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, and bruiſe the Figs; then take the ſharpeſt and ſtrongeſt Muſtard ſeed, bruiſe it by it ſelf, pouring on a little of the colature of the Figs, which will make it beat more eaſily: but take heed too much be not mixed; leſt it be too thin and liquid; then reduce them into ſmall maſſes, of the Figs and Muſtard, of each equal parts: but if you would have the Sinapiſm ſtronger, take two parts of the Muſtard, and one of the Figs; if weaker, two of the Figs, and one of the Muſtard.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>If the Sinapiſm be made with Vinegar, it is more inefficaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and weak, becauſe Vinegar diſcuſſes the ſtrength of the Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtard.</p>
                           <p>The Sinapiſm ſhould be put upon a Linnen cloth, and ſo adhibited to the place, and ſhould be often looked at, to ſee if it have contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted rubour enough by its admotion, for ſome perceive its effect on them ſooner, ſome later, ſo that I cannot certainly define what
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:37350:139"/>ſpace of time it muſt abide on the place. But if the Sinapiſm after long admotion act not, nor alter the colour of the skin, it muſt be fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with hot water with a ſponge, that the faculty of the Sina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſm may be eaſier intromitted; for the Sinapiſm, by extracting the excrements to the skin, either ulcerates, or at leaſt rubrifies it; whence it is called a Phaenigm, that is, a rubrifying Medicament.

                              <hi>HIppocrates,</hi> (<hi>Aph. ult. lib.</hi> 7.) ſaith right; <hi>What Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments cannot cure, the Sword may; what the Sword cannot, Fire may; but what Fire cannot, is altogether incurable.</hi> For a Diſeaſe is oft ſo efferous, as it will yield to no Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cament, but muſt either be cured by ſection, or uſtion, or both. Now uſtion is oft performed with a hot Iron, which were able to terrifie the moſt magnanimous; in whoſe ſtead the ſedulity of our Medicks have invented a Medicament, which from its operation and effect they name a Pyrotick; for in its efficacy it reſembles fire, by its application it kills the quick fleſh, abſumes the dead fleſh, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forates the ſound part, that it may receive the excretion of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound, opens the unſound that it eructate its own excrements. Thus a Pyrotick makes an abſceſs for the corruption to break through; thus it breaks the impoſtume, and pertunds the fwellings, that each may diſgorge its own poyſon.</p>
                           <p>Pyroticks are applyed to divers parts of the body, as ſometimes to the head, ſometimes to the arms, ſometimes to one or other leg, to reſolve and divert rheumatick humours. A Pyrotick is ſometimes applyed to that ſame ample production of the <hi>peritoneum,</hi> where the ſpermatick veins tend to the teſticles, for the cure of the burſting di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe,
<note place="margin">Cauterium ad Herniam.</note> that new fleſh may ſupply the place of the morbid, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the paſſage of the deſcendant inteſtine, that ſo it may be incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerated in its proper place.</p>
                           <p>Many Circulators do ſo much adhibit this method of curation on the incautions diſeaſed, that they burn both Seminaries and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductionary veſſels with their oft repeated Pyroticks.</p>
                           <p>Their materials are all aduſt and cauſtical,

                           <p>THE Teeth are obnoxious to very many vices; for Nigri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude deturpates them, Rottenneſs abſumes them, Laxity ſhakes them, and Dolour moſt grievouſly infeſts them.

                           <p>Many Women would rather endure the Tooth-ach, than their blackneſs, which notwithſtanding the Commonalty regard not: yet ſuch a marcour came upon <hi>Metrodorus</hi> his ſons gums,

                              <hi>HIppocrates (initio lib. de medico)</hi> went not far from the mark, when he ſaid, that beſides other things, artificial culture in apparel, and ſuaveolence, was requiſite to a Phyſician, wherewith the diſeaſed may be as much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted, as he is wont to be offended either with ungratefull, or too fragrant odours: for many men hate thoſe odours that either fill the head, or moleſt the ſenſe, and cauſe head-ach; and on the contrary, are delighted with the vapours that proceed from ſuaveolent ſimples, which recreate the <hi>uterus,</hi> ventricle, heart, and brain. Whereof <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len,</hi> (<hi>cap.</hi> 6. <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de ſympt. cauſ.</hi>) giving a reaſon, and proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating the conſtitution of odours with them of ſapours, (<hi>c.</hi> 21. <hi>l.</hi> 4. <hi>de ſimpl. med. facult.)</hi> ſaith, <hi>As ſapours that are familiar are gratefull and pleaſant, and thoſe ungratefull and unpleaſant which are not fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar; ſo thoſe odours that are familiar to the animal ſpirits, are grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and ſuaveolent thereunto; and thoſe that are not familiar, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſant and maleolent.</hi> And as according to <hi>Galen,</hi> ſweet meats are temperate, ſo according to <hi>Scaliger,</hi> ſuaveolent Medicaments are moderately hot.</p>
                           <p>Which things being thus, pleaſant Odoraments muſt needs be gratefull to the brain, and principal parts. Yet ſome of them are hot in the third degree, as Cinnamon, Cloves, and ſweet Cane, which we do not uſe ſave in ſmall quantity, or intermixed with ſuch things as temper their heat: for Odoraments objected to the noſe in great quantity, are graveolent, and hurtfull to the brain; which recreate it in ſmall quantity, becauſe their graveolency is tempered with the ambient air,

But maleolent things, though tempered with the ambient air, are averſe to the brain both in quality and ſubſtance; according to <hi>Galen, (cap.</hi> 10. <hi>lib. de inſtrum. odorat.</hi>) which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> alſo confirms, whil'ſt (<hi>cap.</hi> 24. <hi>lib.</hi> 8. <hi>de Hiſt.

                           <p>Seeing then that ſuaveolent Odours are conſocial to the ſpirits; and their familiar <hi>Pabulum,</hi> the Phyſician will not onely acquire praiſe of the Vulgar by being perfumed, but he will be better able to preſcribe Odoraments, both to roborate the ſpirits, and defend ſanity.</p>
                           <p>Now they are either deſcribed in form of an Unguent, or of a Pomander, or of Trochisks, or of Powder. An Odorament in form of Powder is thus confected.</p>

(<hi>Ariſt. c.</hi> 2. <hi>l.</hi> 4. <hi>de gen. animal.</hi>) For many Animals live without the uſe of Fire, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the uſe of Water none, with which alone a Spaniſh Virgin did for a long time pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve her life, (<hi>Coel.

And Animals are not ſolely generated and nouriſhed by Water, but Plants alſo, which neither bud nor flouriſh without its benign affluence, but become dry, tabid, and juiceleſs. As on the contrary, the Tree planted by the Water ſide,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 1.</note> will yield its fruit in its ſeaſon. Whence perhaps old <hi>Heſiod</hi> broached his opinion, that Water was the moſt antient of Elements. To which <hi>Thales</hi> accords, who conſtitutes Water the firſt and ſole principle of bodyes. Of which opinion was alſo <hi>Empedocles,</hi> who thought all things to be produced by Water.

                        <p>Now the Water whereof we now treat, that is neceſſary to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde, either to quench his thirſt, or to coct and confect Aliments and Medicaments, is elementary, often deſigned with the name of the frigid Element. And it is either fontane, fluvial, puteal, or plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vial and cyſternial. It is called fontane water, <hi>à fundendo,</hi> becauſe it is poured out of the earth, which is preferred as moſt wholſome. Yet ſome fountains are impaired; for paſſing through the bowels of the earth, they require aliene faculties, for they mutuate their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour or ſapour from the places through which they permeate: Thus ſome, which are trajected through ſulphureous paſſages, are ſo hot, that they may not be uſed; others, becauſe of thoſe veins of Alume, and involutions of Vitriol, are ſo acid and ingratefull, that a thirſty man would not taſte them. In <hi>Germany,</hi> beyond Rhene, there is a fountain of ſweet water, whereof if one drink, his teeth will fall out within two years.</p>
                        <p>In many parts of <hi>France</hi> there are Medicinal Waters of aliene, inſuave, and ſtrange ſapours, as the Pucenſian Wells, whereunto people flock in multitudes yearly, and return ſucceſsfully. But I purpoſe not here to treat of theſe, it ſhall ſuffice me to ſhew at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent what qualities water that is potable, and requiſitely neceſſary to an Apothecary in confecting Medicaments, ſhould be endued withall.</p>
                        <p>Now ſuch water, according to <hi>Ariſtotle, (lib. de ſenſu &amp; ſenſib.)</hi> ſhould in it ſelf be the mixture, matter, and ſeminary of all ſpours; or as <hi>Galen</hi> (<hi>c.</hi> 15. <hi>l.</hi> 1. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2. <hi>l.</hi> 2. <hi>de alim.</hi>) writes, ſhould be inſipid, voyd of all qualities, and moſt light, but not in weight, as ſome would hence inferr, for then Snow-water would be beſt, becauſe lighteſt, which we know to be unwholſome: but it ſhould be of te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuious parts, quickly calefied, and quickly refrigerated; ſuch as fontane and fluvial water is, if it be pure; in defect whereof, rain water, by <hi>Galen</hi>'s advice, <hi>(lib. de Ptiſ.)</hi> may be aſſumed, eſpecially to the confection of Hydromel. Yet our Colledge at <hi>Paris</hi> judge Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternine waters unwholſome, as being dead, and having contracted ſome vice from the air from the ſpout through which, and from the trough into which they delabe; for the ſhower that proceeds from air of an inquinated, peſtilentious, and putrified quality, muſt needs participate thereof; the ſhower that waſhes the ſides of houſes, muſt needs be infected with corruption, or other filth, eſpecially if it wan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap> motion, which is the foul of water. The ſhower that is contained in a Ciſtern, though well grounded with ſand, muſt needs be corrupted, eſpecially when abundance of impure water delabes, for then the ſand will putrify and inquinate it. Hence the water afterwards run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning out of that Ciſtern, is endued with a very bad odour and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour, and is uſeleſs. The very condition of rain accelerates its cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, which being partaker of the airs lenity, is quickly corrupted. Yea, many Authors of credit have writ, that many Fiſhes have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived detriment by rain, as the Muller, or Ceſtreus, whoſe eyes
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:37350:151"/>are white, and they at that time very macilent. The beſt water therefore is fontane, fluvial, and puteal water, ſo it be not muddy nor ferid, but inſipid, that is, endued with no manifeſt quality, nor mixed with any aliene ſapour, as of Salt, Nitre, Sulphur, Bitumen, Alome, or others of that kinde.

                        <p>THE antient Romanes ſacrificing to their Gods, continually offered Wine; whence the Poet, <hi>Redduntur merito debita vina Jovi.</hi> For (ſaith <hi>Plato</hi>) they dedicated Wine to the Gods, that they might expell all cares from Men, and fill their hearts with gladneſs; for <hi>Bacchus</hi> is the reſt bringing God to affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted Mortals. Natures Storehouſe contains nothing better than Wine, which is the beſt Balſame to cure wounds, the moſt excellent Cordial to refreſh the ſpirits, and the moſt eximious Aliment to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh the body; which its name ſeems to denote: for it is called <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, that is, from helping, according to that of <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi> If thou drinkeſt, thou wilt finde help; for it letificates marts heart, exhilarates his minde, makes his age florid, takes away ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, cheriſhes native calour, calefies his bowels, helps concoction, roborates the ſtomack, takes away obſtructions, prepares the paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges for the excluſion of the excrements, moves urine, reſarciates the ſpirits, diſcuſſes flatuoſity, obtunds frigid poyſons, attenuates, cocts and diſcuſſes craſs humours. And that I may comprehend its immenſe dignity in a few words, Wine is the blood of the earth, old mens milk; life iſſuing from the Vine, that conſerves life in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, yea, and ſuppeditates them <hi>Aqua vitae;</hi> whence Alchymiſts call it the Elixar of life: All which, when the Greek Poer had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced and acknowledged as moſt true, he did with ſuch alacrity adore Wine, for <hi>Laudibus arguitur vine vinoſus Homerus;</hi> that he thereby attained not onely the knowledge of abſtruſe Sciences, but alſomoſt eximious eloquence; for <hi>Faecundi calices quem non fecere diſertum?</hi> For as it is vulgarly received, Wine acuates the ingenui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and rouſes the ſpirits:
<note place="margin">Eunium &amp; Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſchylum non ſcripſiſſe carnii<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, niſi vino fuerint madidi.</note> for which cauſe the Poet <hi>Ennius</hi> would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver betake himſelf to the deſcription of Verſes, unleſs he were firſt well madefied with Wine. <hi>Aeſchylus</hi> alſo never accinged himſelf to write Tragedies, unleſs he had firſt imbibed himſelf with Wine. It is alſo ſtoried of <hi>Lampris,</hi> that being then moſt apt to ſpeak and anſwer to the purpoſe, and diſcreetly,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:37350:152"/>when he had ingurgitated much wine. He was wont to ſay of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that he was like Frank incenſe, which never emits its ſuaveolence, till it be well calefied. In wine there is eloquence, in wine verity, in wine alacrity: for this, as the Proverb hath it, will make an old Wife dance. It was a Piacle among the Hebrews, to abſtain from wine; and a cuſtome among the Perſians, never to treat and decrae of any ſerious matters, till they had been well drunk, <hi>(Alex. ab Alex.)</hi> yet <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith of <hi>Plato,</hi> that he never permitted Souldiers, nor Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, nor Princes, nor ſuch as were to conſult about any matter, to drink wine liberally, becauſe it would tyrannize over the faculties of the ſoul; and taken in exceſs, enervate the ſtrength, and deſtroy ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. Whence <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſaith; that in wine is ſickneſs and ſanity, moderation and ferity, peace and war; according to that of the Poet, <hi>Vinum alit lites, lites diſſolvit eaſdem.</hi> Wine therefore is adia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorous and indifferent, good or evil,
<note place="margin">Vinum ſanis robur.</note> as its uſe is good or evil. And as it is ſanity and ſtrength to the ſane, ſo it is infirmity to the infirm, and eſpecially to ſuch as are diſtempered from a hot cauſe.</p>
                        <p>There are many ſorts of wine differenced by their colour,
<note place="margin">Vini differentiae</note> ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour, ſubſtance, odoar, virtue, and place; from their colour, they are called white, red, black, flave, claret, and palid wines; from their ſapour, ſweet, auſtere, ſharp, aceth, inſipid; from their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, crafs, thin, feculent; from their odour, ſweet, fragrant, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odorous; from their virtue, vinous, aquous, polyphorous, multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>farious, and oligophorous; from their place, Falernian, Albane, Grecian: of which antient wines we ſhould drink moderately, by <hi>Galen</hi>'s advice, (<hi>c.</hi> 6. <hi>l.</hi> 5. <hi>de ſanit. tuend.</hi>) for they gravidate the head; but we want all theſe: yet ours are no leſs vinous, as our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relian, Burgundian, Andine, Ainian, Meudonian, Ruelliane, and Argentoliane,

                           </gap>, is ſharp, or rather dead wine, for it is produced out of vapid wine, deſtitute of its proper ſpirits, and innate calour: and as Omphacy is elegantly tearmed wine increaſing, ſo is Vinegar wine decreaſing, for wine is the mean betwixt both. And vinegar is more tenuious, acute, and liquid than both, and therefore it doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete or congeal in froſt, if it be made of wine; which is the moſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lubrious and eximioius: for that which in ſome Countryes is made of ſtale beer, is inſane, and ſhould not at all be uſed by an Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cary in his Confectures: for when we put vinegar abſolutely, we mean wine-vinegar ſo confected by age or artifice, not by any ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant mixture, which for its eximious qualities is uſed in kitchins to Sauces and Condiments; in Pharmacopolies, to the preparation of Oxymel, Lythargy, and other Compounds.</p>
                        <p>Now all vinegar is attenuative, inciſive, diſcuſſive, repreſſive, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frigerative, and ſomewhat calefactive, (<hi>Gal. cap.</hi> 10. <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>comp. med. loc.</hi>) for old <hi>Homer</hi> acknowledges, that it retains in it ſome ſeeds of calour; whence <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith, (<hi>cap.</hi> 19. <hi>l.</hi> 1. <hi>de ſimpl. med.</hi>) it is of a mixt quality; for as milk is not all homogeneous, and ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, nor in all parts the ſame, ſo neither is vinegar, which many ſay is calid, and many frigid. But ſuch as have truly perpended its fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, finde it for the moſt part more frigid than calid, (<hi>cap.</hi> 20. <hi>ejuſdem libri</hi>) And I much recede from their opinion, who think it to be calid like a Cautery, or Pyrotick; for by ſenſe we finde, that when it is applyed, it is at firſt ſharp and refrigerative; but after its ablation, ſome calour follows, which happens accidentally, and becauſe of its acrimony, though not alwayes, nor to all bodyes, (<hi>c.</hi> 21. <hi>ejuſdem libri.</hi>)</p>
                        <p>Hence we may collect, that vinegar is naturally frigid, but hath acquired an accidentary calidity; or as <hi>Galen</hi> ſpeaks, (<hi>cap.</hi> 23. <hi>ejuſdem libri</hi>) neither abſolutely frigid, nor abſolutely calid, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipating of neither extream; for many things that conſiſt of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary and pugnant qualities, ſeem ſimple to the ſenſe, and are judged as neuters; for it is unavoydable that vinegar, having loſt its innate quality, ſhould acquire another by putrefaction. Of which opinion is <hi>Theophraſtus</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotle;</hi> for the vinous parts of the wine tranſeating into vinegar, muſt be refrigerated, and the aquous parts thereof by putretude obtain an adventitious calidity, as all
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:37350:153"/>things elſe which putrefy, do, (<hi>c.</hi> 2. <hi>l.</hi> 4. <hi>ſimpl.</hi>) Vinegar then is a compound of parts of a contrary quality, to wit, partly calid, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly frigid, as the aſhes of burned wood. Yet Vinegar is of admirable utility to Mortals; but it is more frequently uſed of others, than of Apothecaries.</p>

                        <p>SUgar was unknown to the Antients; which is now ſo co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious, that to ſay a Pharmacopoly without Sugar, were more than an
<note n="*" place="margin">Ironia.</note> Irony. Yet it doth not fall from Heaven like dew, nor is it gathered of Plants leaves, as ſome have thought, who look onely at the name: but it is got of an arundi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naceous Plant, which grows not onely in <hi>India,</hi> but in many places of <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Africa,</hi> and now in ſome Gardens in <hi>France;</hi> but it ſcarcely eſcapes ſecure from the Winters tempeſts.</p>
                        <p>This ſacchariferous Plant is about eight foot high, very craſs,
<note place="margin">Planta ſaccha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifera.</note> knotty, obduced on every ſide with long, ſtrait, and twined leaves, hollow, ſappy, and ſtuffed within with plenty of ſweet juice, which will diſtill down the cut cane like Amber; whoſe pith or ſap being ſevered from the cane by a knife, and cocted on the fire, will turn all into Sugar, ſave a little Salt at the bottome of the veſſel. Its roots emulate the roots of our Cane, but they are not ſo ligneous, but more ſucculent and ſweet, from which ſome ſprigs erupt, which if pulled up, and tranſplanted in due time, will grow and flouriſh. It bears hairy flowers, like our reeds, which one thing is enough to ſhew that it is a reed.</p>
                        <p>The juice extracted from it, and but once cocted, is not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently elaborate, but is red, and thence called brown Sugar; by ſome, Sugar-froth; which when it is cocted longer, and more defecated; will be white, and is called Sugar abſolutely. There comes Sugar from <hi>Madara</hi> and <hi>Canary,</hi> which is extraordinary white, which as much excells the other in worth, as it doth in candour: yet ſome Negotiators bring ſome a little duller, which is as good as the other. But many adulterate Madarenſian Sugar, by waſhing common Sugar with lixive, cocting it again, and abſterging the nigritude from off it, by which means they make it exceeding white, but not ſo ſweet, and gratefull.</p>
                        <pb n="224" facs="tcp:37350:154"/>
                        <p>Sugar-Candy is thus made of common Sugar.
<note place="margin">Sacharum can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum quomodo fiat.</note> Let the Sugar be melted with a little water, and elixated like a craſs ſyrup, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject into an earthen pot, wherein wooden ſticks are put lattice-wiſe, and croſs one over another; ſet the pot on a board in a hot place, where leave it for the ſpace of fifteen or twenty dayes, then pour out the ſyrup that is not concreted, and pour in a little warm water, to waſh off the fatneſs of the ſyrup, which again pour out, and repoſe the veſſel in a hot place; take it on the morrow, and break it, and you ſhall finde the ſticks laden with Sugar-Candy, ſhining like Cryſtal.</p>
                        <p>There is another kinde of Sugar not ſo white,
<note place="margin">Powder-ſugar.</note> nor yet ſo craſs as the former, which is partly pulverated, partly redacted to more craſs lumps, which the vulgar call Caſſonade, or Caſtonade; which is not onely uſed in Kitchins, but alſo in Shops.</p>
                        <p>That which is brought us from far Countryes, is turbinated pyra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midal-wiſe, and commonly called Sugar-loaf, which is leſs cocted, and leſs obdurate than Candy, and ſo leſs calid, and more accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate to obdulcorate Condiments, Broths, and other Aliments; for Sugar abates acrity, retunds acidity, gratifies auſterity, and makes all ſapours more ſuave. Whence not onely Confectioners, but Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers and Cooks frequently uſe Sugar, for no delicate Diſh comes on the Table that doth not participate of Sugar; for if Water, Wine, Fruits, Fleſh, Fiſh, or other Edibles or Potables be nauſcated, the mixture of a little Sugar will make them current.</p>
                        <p>All Sugar is moderately hot,

                           <hi>AThenaus</hi> writes, that the Cyrians, Inhabitants of <hi>Corſtea,</hi> are therefore long-lived, becauſe they daily uſe Honey: And <hi>Democritus</hi> being asked, how a man might preſerve his life long in ſanity, anſwered, by anointing his interiour parts with Honey, his exteriour with Oil, (<hi>Gal. c.</hi> 11. <hi>l. de atten. vict. rat.</hi>) For Honey being moſt ſweet, propagates moſt tenuious juice. And (<hi>c.</hi> 8. <hi>l.</hi> 2. <hi>de facult. nat.</hi>) begets in old men ſpecial good blood, in young and bilious men much choler; for according to <hi>Actuarius,</hi> (<hi>c.</hi> 8. <hi>l. de ſpir. anim. mot.</hi>) that which is ſweet in Honey, muſt needs be choler in the body.</p>
                        <p>And this mutation is very facile, becauſe Honey, according to

                        <p>Honey alone is a Compound of it ſelf, for it is collected of the juices of many herbs and flowers, and is profitable to all ages, but eſpecially to old men, and ſuch as are of a cold conſtitution, chiefly in winter time; for where it meets with much calour, there it turns into choler.</p>
                        <p>

                        <p>Now Honey, according to <hi>Galen,</hi> (<hi>c.</hi> 177. <hi>l. de ſimpl. med.</hi>)

                        <p>Yet ſomething from Plants tends to its benignity or malignity, (<hi>Orib. c.</hi> 62. <hi>l.</hi> 2. <hi>collect.</hi>) for that is poyſonous which is collected of poyſonous Plants, as Wolfs-bane, (<hi>Paul.

                        </head>
                        <p>THere are four common emollitive Herbs, Mallows, Marſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mallows, black Violet, and Bears-breech, or brank Urſine; whereunto other four leſs famous are adjoyned, to wit, Mercury, Pelitory of the wall, <hi>Sicla,</hi> commonly called Bete, and Arach, whoſe uſe is celebrated in making the decoctions of mollitive Glyſters, and Cataplaſms.</p>
                        <p>Now Mallows is ſo denominated from its mollifying quality;
<note place="margin">Malva unde dicta.</note> and it is either Hortenſian, which by culture and mangony will grow to a tree, and acquire great procerity; or Sylveſtrian, which is well enough known to all; for it abounds every where with thick cireina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and angulous leaves; it puts forth flowers all Summer long of a pale purple colour; its roots are ſmall, long, and lignous; its ſeed ſmall, ſmooth, and orbicular.</p>
                        <p>There are many ſorts of Mallows.
<note place="margin">Malvarum differentiae.</note> The firſt of that name is that which importunely germinates in every way ſide, or court.</p>
                        <p>The ſecond is not ſo copious, which is ſmaller, with leſſer boughs, growing about rude and incultivated places near Villages, with flowers of a pale purple colour.</p>
                        <p>The third is called the Mallow tree,
<note place="margin">Arboreſcens.</note> which like a ſhrub ſprouts up to the height of ſix or eight cubits.</p>
                        <p>The fourth is called <hi>Althea,</hi> by the Latines <hi>Biſ-malva,</hi> and <hi>Ibiſcus,</hi> becauſe of the multiplicity of its faculties; for it hath malvaceous, ſmooth, long, hoary, and ſomewhat clipped; whiter flowers, and ſeeds like other wilde Mallows.</p>
                        <p>Its roots are craſs, long, round, divaricated into many circles, and pregnant with much juice; its ſprigs that grow beſides it put forth malvaceous, long, hoary, and tomentaceous leaves, white flowers, and ſmall, plain, and round ſeeds, like other Mallows. It
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:37350:158"/>calefies in the firſt degree; it hath a digeſtive and laxative faculty, and will coct mucaginous excrements.</p>
                        <p>The fifth is called <hi>Alcea,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Alcea.</note> which is like Mallows in its original and ſtalk, but deeper cut; out of its root proceeds abundance of ſhrubs half a cubite long, adorned with red flowers; which fallen off, we may ſee a round ſeed like other Mallows.</p>
                        <p>The ſixth is called <hi>Tranſmarina,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Tranſmarina.</note> and <hi>Roſacea,</hi> from the elegancy of its flower, like a Roſe. It is known in all parts, for it is ſown and cultivated almoſt in every Garden; it puts forth its branches at the beginning of the Spring.</p>
                        <p>Some ſorts of <hi>Ibiſcaes</hi> are referred to the kinds of Mallows, to wit, the <hi>Althea</hi> that grows like a tree, the <hi>Althea</hi> that grows like a fen, and the <hi>Althea</hi> of <hi>Theophraſtus,</hi> which bears yellow flowers. There are alſo as many ſorts of <hi>Alcea,</hi> to wit, the common, forreign, and ſhrubby, which is Cinquefoil.</p>
                        <p>All Mallows is mollitive,
<note place="margin">Vires.</note> and thence it is denominated; and its leaves decocted are good for the ſhingles; and it is good againſt poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonous ſtings, and the dolours excited by Bees or Waſps.</p>

                        <p>Its roots are juicy, long, red, and glutinous, which are of little or no uſe in Phyſick; though made into a Liniment, they are good for burnings; and drunk, move urine, and conduce to the good of ſuch as are tabid, for their leaves onely are deſumed to the decoction of Glyſters and Cataplaſms, to which uſe ſolely the whole Plant is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinated, and got by Apothecaries.</p>
                        <p>Some ſay it is called brank Urſine, becauſe its leaves reſemble the fore feet of Bears. We finde it alſo called <hi>Paederota,</hi> and <hi>Melam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyllum.</hi>

                        <p>There is alſo a third kinde of Mercury, called Cynocrambe, or wilde maſculine Mercury, which grows all over by high wayes, and humid places; which, becauſe it hath much affinity with the maſculine, it hath pleaſed learned Authors to denote it by that name.</p>

                        <p>THE many names that Pelitory of the wall hath put upon it, hath cauſed learned men to doubt which is the true Herb, or it due name. It is moſt frequently by Apothecaries called <hi>Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xine,</hi> of which name <hi>Dioſcorides</hi> deſcribes two Plants. The firſt is firnamed <hi>Ciſſampelos,</hi> and it is a kinde of <hi>convolvulus,</hi> which grows in hedges, and circumeats the vicine Plants: the other in walls and maceries; whence it is called <hi>Parietaria,</hi> or mural Herb, as alſo Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xine, becauſe it adheres to ones cloaths; it emits ſmall, pale, moſſy
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:37350:159"/>flowers, and very rough leaves, which being good to wipe and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terge glaſs cups with, are thence called Vitreols.

                        <p>It is refrigerative and deterſive, and cures inflammations. If it be fryed with Oil or Butter, and applyed to the region of the reins, it eaſes the dolour of the gravel there, and accelerates its excluſion by reſerating the paſſages; and therefore it is duely inſtituted by <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius</hi> an Ingredient in the confection of the ſyrup of <hi>Althea.</hi>

<note place="margin">Herbae capilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res unde habe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant nomen.</note> commonly called Polytrick, or Spleen-wort; and <hi>Salvia Vita,</hi> or Wall-rue. Some would have <hi>Epithymus,</hi> and Bind-weed, or Dodder, to be true Capillaries, becauſe they reſemble hairs and Capilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; whereas theſe five Herbs are not called Capillaries ſo much from their external form, as that faculty wherewith they colour hairs, and reſartiate their defect.</p>
                        <p>The true Maiden-hair is moſt frequently found in the Narbonian Tract; ſometimes, but ſeldome, in other colder parts of <hi>France:</hi> that which in one year flouriſhed at <hi>Lutetia</hi> in the Garden of <hi>Joannes Gomerius</hi> the expert Apothecary, the rigour of the Winter killed ere another year circulated.</p>
                        <p>It is a ſmall Herb, without ſtalk, flower, and ſeed, growing in mountainous, rocky, ſhady, moyſt places, and in the brinks of foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains; in ſtead of a ſtalk it hath many hairs, whereon ſmall, ſlender leaves, not unlike the leaves of Coriander, do adhere; whence <hi>Meſue</hi> calls it the Coriander of the ſountain.

                        <p>Some credulous perſons think it a miracle, that <hi>Adiantum</hi> infuſed in water, ſhould not be madefied, but ſhould ſo withſtand its humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, as alwayes to appear dry, from which event it deſumed this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination; but its longer demerſion in water ſhews the contrary.

                        <p>
                           <hi>Adiantum</hi> emits out of its ſlender root compacted of ſmall fila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, certain exile ſprigs, ſtrait, half a hand high, and ſometimes longer, ſometimes of a whiter, ſometimes of a blacker green, cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumveſted with little ſoft leaves, after the manner, poſiture and rite of a fern, but much more ſmall, more green on one ſide, leſs on another, and maculated with ſome ſpots. It grows beſt in opake places, it is alwayes green, never ſcatters its leaves, but is deſtitute of all flowers and ſeed.</p>
                        <p>Its faculties are commended for many purpoſes, for it prohibites the falling of hairs, and repairs their loſs; it helps ſuch as are purſy, and ſhort breath'd; it moves flowers, diſcuſſes ſwelling in the neek, and produces the ſame effect with true Maidens-hair, or <hi>Capilus Veneris.</hi>

                        <p>THis Plant is next in affinity to a Capillary,
<note place="margin">Salvia vita.</note> which from the ſuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude of the leaves, and the congruity of place wherein Rue and it grow, is called mural Rue, and by the Shopmen, <hi>Salvia vita.</hi> It thrives beſt in opake rocks, wet ſtones, old edifices and caves, which as it were dividing the rocks, proceeds out of their inciſures, with thin, ſhort and ſlender ſtalks, whereon little but craſs leaves ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here; divided, and of a whitely green colour, very like to Rue.</p>
                        <p>The whole Plant is ſcarce as long as a mans palm, devoyd of ſeed and ſlowers, alwayes green; and therefore it is often uſed in win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, when other Plants are either withered or cradicated.</p>
                        <p>It reſerates the excrementitious paſſages,
<note place="margin">Vires.</note> takes away obſtructions, moves excrements, exſiccates watry humours, and thence conduces to the ſtoppings of the ſpleen and meſenteries; it moves flowers and urine, expells the ſtone, cures the dropſy, and helps diſeaſes within the breaſt. They are miſtaken that think this is Fellon-graſs.</p>

                        <p>DOdder grows upon fruitfull Herbs, like Epithyme,
<note place="margin">Dodder epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thymus.</note> deſtitute of a root; but as <hi>Matthiolus</hi> faith, iſſues out of the ſtalk of a Plant like a wing, or long capillament. It grows moſt abundantly about Line, whence the Shopmen call it, Lines Podagry.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Fuchſius</hi> not without reaſon believes, that Dodder at firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from ſome root, which withers and periſhes when its capilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments do involve a plant, from which it may ſuck nutriment; and thence it is that the temperament and quality of the Dodder changes according to the variety and nature of the Plants which it involves. And many think, that Dodder and Epithyme differ not, ſave that the one grows on Line, the other on Thyme.</p>
                        <p>Yet <hi>Matthiolus</hi> will not ſuffrage herewith, but contends, and that by teſtimony from <hi>Galen,</hi> that both the form and qualities are in them different; for Epithyme calefies in the third degree, and Cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuta onely in the ſecond; but here it onely follows, that Epithyme borrows its calefactive quality from Thyme, Cuſcuta from Line. They do very dangerouſly miſtake, who take the podagry of other Plants for true Cuſcuta and Epithyme.</p>
                        <p>Neither of them have any leaves, they are onely hairy, putting forth ſlender capillaments, like Cittern ſtrings, out of which iſſues forth ſmall flowers like gliſtering ſtars, gravidated with ſmall ſeeds, which ingrede the compoſition of the laxative ſyrup of Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cory and Rhabarb.</p>
                        <p>It is abſterſive and roborative, it cures the obſtructions of the liver and ſpleen, moves urine, helps the jaundies, and is good for all affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions proceeding from cholerick and melancholick humours.</p>

<note place="margin">Aſparagus.</note> either becauſe it grows upon a rough, ſharp ſhrub, or its ſtalk being full of pricks, or elſe becauſe it grows ſpontaneouſly without ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.

                        <p>Now Sperage is either wilde, or ſative, and both notorious e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, putting forth many ſprigs, and many little, long and ſlender leaves, which like Fennel, end in Capillaments.</p>
                        <p>This Pot-herb delights in ſiccity, and periſhes by frequent riga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; yet if it be irrigated in Autumn, it will put forth tender and ſucculent buds.</p>

                        <p>It is a kinde of ferulaceous Plant, ſometimes exceeding a mans height; its ſtalk is geniculated, filled with a fungous ſap; its external cortex is ſmooth and green, its leaf like Maiden-weed, ſlender, long, ſoft, capillaccous, and ſuaveolent; its muſcary or top, round, patu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, broad, and circulated, whereon there depends a nude, long, and pale ſeed; its root is long, craſs, white, and odoriferous.</p>

                        <p>Being drunk in wine, it helps the poyſon of Serpents, moves flowers and urine, generates milk, and cures ſuffuſion.</p>

<note place="margin">† Gum Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cory.</note>

                           <hi>Hieracium,</hi> Sow-thiſtle, Garden-Endive, wild Lettices, and all intubaceous Plants. But when we put Succory ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely, we mean of the wild Succory, which comes more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently into uſe in Medicine; and it is the genus of all thoſe diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences of ſative and wild Intubacies.</p>
                        <p>The ſative Succory, or Intube, is by the Greeks called <hi>Seris,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Intybum. Seris. Scariola. Endivia. Intybolacha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num.</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is ſown: whereof there are two ſorts, the one broad leafed, which ſome call Garden Endive; the other narrow leafed, which is called <hi>Seris,</hi> Garden Succory, or Endive; and by <hi>Sylvius,</hi> Intube. <hi>Galen</hi> calls them both <hi>Intubolachanum,</hi> that is, edible Endive, becauſe Succory is repoſed among pot-herbs for broth and ſallets.</p>
                        <p>To the wild Succory are referred Sow-thiſtle, or yellow Succory,
<note place="margin">Taraxacum. Dens Leonis.</note> Lyons tooth, <hi>Hedypnois,</hi> ſo called, becauſe it conciliates ſleep; which <hi>Rondeletius</hi> calls <hi>Dioſcorides</hi> his Chondril; by ſome, Monks-head; by others, Urinal.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Cicerbita,</hi> or Sow-thiſtle, in French <hi>Laicteron,</hi> becauſe its juice is lacteous, is of the family of Endives, and grows in any place, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cultivated, or not; whereof <hi>Dioſcorides</hi> makes three ſorts, the ſharp, the ſmooth, and the procerous. The firſt is called by ſome Sows-ſnout. <hi>Cluſius</hi> tells us of five ſorts, two vulgar, the ſmooth, and the ſmoother; two auſtrial, the ſmooth, and the ſmoother; one Pannonical.</p>
                        <p>To the wild Succory alſo are referred all the ſorts of Chondrils, whereof ſome conſtitute onely two, others three, beſides <hi>Zacinth,</hi> or Wart-wort, and Perdion, which ſome call Sea-Chondril; others, Bulboſe. So that all the ſorts of Chondrils are ſix, which reſpond more to the ſorts of Succory in faculties, than in form.</p>
                        <p>And if we may from affinity of qualities inferr conformity in a genus,
<note place="margin">Hieracia.</note> then may Hawk-weed be repoſed among the ſorts of Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cories; or as others will, among the Sow-thiſtles. Now there are many ſorts of Hawk-weed, to wit, the greater, broad leafed, narrow leafed with a ſhort root, the long rooted, the Hawk-weed of the Valley, and of the Mountains; ſome with leaves like Succory, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers both in leaf and form like Chondrils, about which conſult the more recent Herbaliſts.</p>

                        <p>But that I may return from whence I deviated;
<note place="margin">The various names of Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cory.</note> the various names of Succory have much obſcured the ſorts thereof: for the genus is oft put for the ſpecies, the ſpecies for the genus, and one ſpecies for another, and yet all deſigned by one name. Theſe names are often attributed to Succory, <hi>Ambubeia, Picris, Intybum, Seris, Endivia, Seariola, Intubolachanum,</hi> yea and all the ſpecies of Hawk-weed, <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerbita, Soncius, Chondrilla,</hi> and wild Lettice are denoted by the name Succory.</p>
                        <p>Wild Lettice hath affinity with the kind of Succory, for it bears leaves like Garden-Endive, and in nature reſponds to the ſorts of Poppy, though it cructates a ſoporiferous and poyſonous odour, like Opium.</p>
                        <p>The ſeeds of wild Succory and Endive are they which are deſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med for the ſeeds leſs frigid, whoſe qualities the appellation ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently indicates.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>This Plant is neither like Smallage nor Fennel, as <hi>Fuchſius</hi> and <hi>Ruellius</hi> aſſert, but a medium betwixt both: for its leaves are not ſo broad as Smallage, nor yet ſo ſmall and capillaceous as Fennel.

It is ſown, and grows plentiouſly in <hi>Spain, Italy,</hi> and ſome hot parts of <hi>France;</hi> if its ſeed be injected on fat ſoyl, it fruticates moſt of all Pot herbs; and ſome Idiots think, that it ſpreads moſt if it be ſown by ſome wicked and malevolent perſon: but their opinion is rather deriſible than probable.</p>
                        <p>The wild Cumin puts forth leaves like Chervil; exile ſtalks like Shepherds needle; it is capitulated with five or ſix round, hairy heads, wherein lodges ſour ſeeds.</p>

                           <hi>AMomum</hi> is not onely reckoned amongſt exotical, but unknown Plants, for none of the Antients have accurately delivered its form or deſcription: and <hi>Cluſius,</hi> of the more recent Herbaliſts, who was very diligent in ſearching, and deſirous to finde out the knowledge of this Art, hath left us three images or forms of this Herb: but we can ſcarce by probable conjecture finde which is its true effigies of theſe three; nay, we may as well think that none of them reſpond to it. Firſt, he ſaith it is like a branch of a certain tree, which by its odour and ſuavity challenges affinity with the tree that bears Cloves, but its leaves and fruit are leſſer and rounder than the Clove trees. Secondly (ſaith he) it well reſembles the branches of paralious <hi>Tithymal.</hi> Thirdly, it is reſembled by a ſhort bough loaden with grains, like <hi>Cardamomum,</hi> hanging in cluſters.

                        <p>This Plant is very fecund, for one root will produce and nouriſh fifty heads. It conſiſts commonly of one ſtalk two cubits high, and ſometimes higher, comous, with leaves like Ragwort, but ſomething longer, twined, and green, with a flower in form of a basket, whole <hi>labra</hi> conſtitute a circle, out of which bottom iſſue ſhining tufts, like yellow yearn, and whoſe extremity is tuberous.</p>
                        <p>This broad and elegant flower adhering to a ſmall, ſlender, and languid peduncle; and another to a craſs and rigid branch, encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed with leaves, which withers about the end of Summer, and buds again at the beginning of Autumn.</p>
                        <p>There are many ſorts of Lillyes; for beſides the white and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, which is ſo called abſolutely, there is another, they call the white Byzantian Lilly, which hath got its diſtinction from the place where it grows; another there is of a cruent colour, another yellow, another light red.

<note place="margin">Saffron.</note> the golden coloured red flower, of a bulbous Plant, which the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians call <hi>Crocus;</hi> the French men following the idiome of the Mauritanians Saffron. But it is a bulbous Plant, lively and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous, whoſe leaf is narrow and gramineous, whoſe flower is like meadow Hermodactyle, with filaments of a purple and golden co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and whoſe odour is intenſe with ſome ſharpneſs. It grows beſt about fountains and high-wayes, rejoycing to be torn and trod upon, which (as they ſay) comes better on by being killed.</p>
                        <p>But the beſt of all grows in <hi>Corycus,</hi> a Mountain of <hi>Cilicia,</hi> for its odour is more fragrant, and its colour more aureous. It is green in the Spring, it dilates it ſelf all Summer, in Autumn are its flowers gathered, which are not uſurped for medicinary and culinary uſes ſolely, but many more, when any aureous colour is deſired.</p>
                        <p>Now <hi>Crocus</hi> is either domeſtick, whereof <hi>Dioſcorides</hi> enumerates many ſorts; or ſylveſtrian, whereof <hi>Dodonaeus</hi> deſcribes more; all which, for brevities ſake, I omit.</p>
                        <p>It is hot in the ſecond degree, dry in the firſt;
<note place="margin">Vires.</note> if moderately u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, it helps the brain, refocillates the ſenſes, excites ſleep and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour; by recreating the heart, it begets joyfulneſs, draws the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours to concoction, and much profits him that knows how to uſe it with prudence. <hi>Meſue</hi> makes an Oil thereof, which ingredes the confection of the Emplaſter made of Frogs.

                           <p>Our vulgar Rhabarb is ſo called, becauſe it is the moſt eximious root among the Barbarians, or Indians, or Troglodites; or perhaps it may derive its denomination from <hi>Rha,</hi> a Rivers name in <hi>Pontus,</hi> as the nomenclature of <hi>Rhaponticum</hi> is from thence probably acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged. But ſince <hi>Rha</hi> in the peregrine idiome denotes a root, <hi>Rha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barbarum,</hi> that is, the Barbarians root, may by an Antonomaſy be put for the beſt root, which the Arabians call <hi>Raved,</hi> the Chinians <hi>Ravam,</hi> where it is moſt frequent, and where it is thus denoted, without further addition.</p>
                           <p>The Rhabarb that comes out of the Dominions of <hi>Sina,</hi> is the moſt approved, where it both grows plentifully, and almoſt ſponta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neouſly; and is thence conveyed into <hi>Ormus, Perſia, Arabia,</hi> and <hi>Alexandria;</hi> which afterwards coming to us, is called Indian, Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bick, and Turkiſh Rhabarb.</p>
                           <p>Rhabarb is very like our common round

                           <p>It is a cholagogous Medicament, benign, and roborative to the liver and ventricle: it conduces very much to dyſenterick, cholerick, and other affections proceeding from the imbecillity of the liver.</p>

                              </gap>, that is, acid Dates; but without reaſon, for they reſemble no Dactyle.</p>
                           <p>The tree whereon Tamarinds grow, is tall, hard, and compact, like our Wallnut tree, or Oak, encompaſſed with many boughs, and adorned with leaves minutely incided, about the magnitude of Palm leaves. Theſe Fruits, when immature, are green and acid; when mature, they are cineritious, their acidity not without ſuavity.</p>
                           <p>But <hi>Meſue</hi> ſpeaks inconſiderately, when according to <hi>Garcla</hi>'s judgement, he thinks that Tamarinds are the fruits of wild Date trees in <hi>India,</hi> whereas there is not a Date tree in all <hi>India,</hi> but what is conveyed from <hi>Arabia.</hi> They grow on a tree fair to look on, bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiated with many boughs, adumbrated with abundance of leaves, like ſome female Fern, called by the Spaniards <hi>Helecho,</hi> coronated with fair, odorate, and white flowers, after whoſe fall, the fruits e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merge, which at firſt are green, and are nocturnally involved in leaves, to keep them from the cold, diurnally expoſed to the Sun.

                           <p>And if <hi>Galen</hi> or <hi>Dioſcorides</hi> have given the name, Myrobalamb, to any Fruit beſides its nature, that ſame differs as much from a true Myrobalamb, as an inodorate thing from an odorate, and a Prune from an Acorn.</p>
                           <p>The nomenclature then is more received by uſe and cuſtome, than by reaſon and nature. And theſe we call Myrobolambs, are but cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſorts of Plums, decerped from as many different trees, as they have different firnames: for the diverſity of their forms and facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties demonſtrate the errours of ſuch, who contend that they grow upon one and the ſame tree, but are ſeverally at divers ſeaſons col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected.</p>
                           <p>There are five ſorts thereof, the flave, the Indian or black,
<note place="margin">Species.</note> the Bellirian, the Chebulian, and the Emblian; many whereof grow in the Kingdome of <hi>Cambaia,</hi> whoſe names <hi>Garcias</hi> hath got from the Inhabitants, and hath delineated the ſeveral trees and fruits in a few words.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Arare</hi> (ſaith he) or the flave Myrobalamb, is round, and bears leaves like <hi>Sobrus: Rezanuale,</hi> or the Indian black Myrobalamb, is eight ſquared, and hath leaves like a Willow. <hi>Gotim,</hi> or the Belli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian, hath leaves like Bay, but more cineritious and pale. <hi>Aretca,</hi> or the Chebulian Myrobalambs, are great and round, yet not perfectly round, but ſomewhat long, when they attain their full growth, and bear leaves like the Peach tree. <hi>Anuale,</hi> or the Emblian, have their leaves minutely incided, and about a hand length.</p>
                           <p>The trees are generally of the magnitude of Plum trees, all wild, growing ſpontaneouſly, none domeſtick. <hi>Avicenna</hi> calls Myroba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſambs, <hi>Delegi;</hi> but the Arabians give peculiar names to each ſort; calling the flave, <hi>Azfar;</hi> the Indian, <hi>Aſuat;</hi> the Bellirian, <hi>Hele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragi;</hi> the Chebulian, <hi>Quebulgi;</hi> the Emblian, <hi>Embelgi.</hi>

And it is a Plant either little, or not at all, like <hi>Scilla,</hi> as ſome conjecture; for its leaves are craſſer, fatter, longer, and broader, ſharp on both ſides, jagged, bent backward, aculeated with blunt pricks, pregnant with viſcid and tenacious juice, and fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liated like the greater Houſe-leek. Its ſtalk is a foot high, its flowers white, and ſeed like Daffadil; its root is ſingle and craſs, like a ſtake ſtruck into the earth.</p>

                           <p>This Plant will, through its tenacious juice, live two years, and emit new leaves, if it be ſet upon a board: but if it be caſt on the ground, it withers.

                           <p>The whole Plant is graveolent, and its ſapour bitter, but eſpecially its juice, which out of what part ſoever it be extracted, is very uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in Medicinal Confections.</p>
                           <p>Its liquor concreted, and brought to us, is of two ſorts; the one ſandy, and contaminated with filth, which we call Aloe Caballine, and uſe in curing horſes, and the like; the other is coacted like a liver, and is thence called Hepatical Aloes, or <hi>Aloe ſuccotrine;</hi> or <hi>Succo-citrine,</hi> its powder being of Citrine, or Orange colour. It is alſo called by ſome, <hi>Socotorine,</hi> becauſe it comes out of an Iſland ſo called. The yellow, fat, clear, and friable, made up like a liver, is the beſt; the black, hard, ſandy, and impure, is not good.</p>
                           <p>It is hot in the firſt degree, dry in the third; applyed, it conden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſates, aſtringes, exſiccates, and glutinates the wounds; aſſumed, it opens, reſerates the paſſages, moves and ſtimulates the Hemorrhoides, roborates the ventricle, ſubduces the belly, purges cholerick and phlegmatick humours, kills and expells belly-worms, takes away ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, exarceates putretude, and preſerves bodyes long from corruption.</p>

It is a ſiliquous Plant, brought to us from the Eaſtern Countryes, much like our <hi>Collutea,</hi> but its leaves better reſemble the greater Myrtle. Flowers of a dusky colour iſſue out of the hollow betwixt its ſtalk and ſtem, appended on tenuious pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicles; to which ſucceed little, long, plain incurvated leaves, gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated with ſmall, brown, compreſſed ſeeds, like Gygars.</p>
                           <p>Its roots, which are long and ſlender, are uſeleſs in Pharmacy, eſpecially if its ſtalk be not long-lived; which being impatient of cold, lives not above four months in the Weſtern Countryes, nor in <hi>Raly</hi> after Autumn.</p>
                           <p>There are two ſorts hereof; one wild, whoſe leaves are leſſer, rounder, and more uſeleſs; the other domeſtical, whoſe leaves are larger more acute, and uſefull.</p>
                           <p>Seeny calefies not ſo much as ſome think;
<note place="margin">Vires.</note> for it is but hot about the end of the firſt degree, or beginning of the ſecond, and dry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the end of the ſecond. It purges clemently both cholcrick and craſs phlegmatick humours; it deterges, digeſts, and expurges all viſeid humours, and aduſt choler from the brain, lungs, ſpleen, liver, ventricle, and meſentery; and cures all diſeaſes in thoſe parts, ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from theſe humours.</p>

This peregrine root is purgative, of a pale colour, and craſs, which puts forth many long, and imbecil boughs, which without fulciments would lay along the ground; but being annexed to perches, they grow up, and with many involutions amplect them like Briony, to which its effigies is very ſimilar, but its faculties diſſident:
<note place="margin">Differentia in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Brioniam &amp; Mechoacam.</note> for Briony is ſharp and hot, Mechoacan almoſt infipid, and voyd of all acrimony. The leaves of Briony are broad, and quinquangular, and divided like Vine leaves, but more ſharp, hirſute, and white; its flowers ſmall, white, racemous, and congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated like Grapes. And Mechoacous leaves are ample, but withall tenuious, ſad-green, and mucronated onely on one ſide, not angular like Briony. Its fruits are many, cohering in bunches about the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnitude of Corianders, which come to maturity in Autumn. The whitiſh and freſheſt root is beſt.</p>
                           <p>Some call this root white Rhabarb; others, American Scammo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; the Pharmacopoliſts, Mechoacan root. That which is very white, or black, or worm-eaten, is naught.</p>
                           <p>It is hot in the firſt degree, and dry in the ſecond; it purges, and that facilely, pituitous and watry humours, not debilitating like other purgatives, but roborating the parts. It ſhould be diſſolved rather in wine than in other liquors; it may be ſafely adhibited to old men and boyes; it conduces very much to ſuch as are infeſted withan inveterate cough, with colick dolour, and with the French diſeaſe.</p>

                           <p>The coniferous Larix tree is of eximious procerity, aſſurging with a ſtrait ſtalk, incorticated with a craſs bark, dehiſcing with fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent chinks, circumveſted with many leaves, ſhort, ſoft, and tenui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, like Pine leaves, not aculeated, but retuſe, which numerouſly cohere together in each tubercle.

                           <p>It is an herb without ſtalk, flower, and ſeed, conſiſting onely of a root and leaves like maſculine fern, but leſſer, and maculated on the under ſide with yellow ſpots.

                           <p>Turbith then, according to <hi>Garcias,</hi> is neither the root of <hi>Alypum,</hi> nor of <hi>Tripoly,</hi> nor of Scammony, nor of <hi>Tapſia,</hi> nor yet any lacteous or ferulaceous Plant; neither is the gummous or domeſtick the beſt, according to <hi>Meſue;</hi> however, there is no Shop wherein good Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bith may not be found noted with thoſe enſigns which <hi>Meſue</hi> gives it.

                           </head>
                           <p>BY Scammony we underſtand not onely the concrete juice of a certain Plant, but alſo the Plant it ſelf. And it is a lacteous, volvulous, ſcanſory, and ſmooth Plant; in leaf, flower, and form, very like Similax; in root ſomewhat different, which in Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milax is ſlender, in Scammony craſs, long, candid within, graveo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and pregnant with juice; out of which, ſlender and viticulous branches iſſue, which climbe up the adjoyning buſhes, amplexing and implicating them. Its leaves are broad, and acuminated like <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſaron,</hi> but leſſer; its flowers are albid and cave, like a ſcale; it grows plenteouſly in fat ſoyl, chiefly in <hi>Antioch</hi> and <hi>Syria.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The liquor commonly called Scammony, is collected out of its roots after ſeveral manners; as firſt, the head of the root is reſected, then excavated with a knife, that the juice may run in the concame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated paſſage, till it be brought to fit receptacles or veſſels ſuppoſited. Secondly, the earth about the root is effoded, and the root left in a concamerated hole, whereunto the juice is profunded upon Wallnut tree leaves therein ſubjected, which after concretion is extracted. Thirdly, the root evelled, is incided, and the juice iſſuing from it, is exſicced, formed into lumps, and preſerved. Fourthly, juice is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted from its leaves and caul by triture, which exſiccated, coacted, and kept. But Scammony ſo educed, is either black, or of a ſal green, which is the worſt; that is beſt, which exudes out of the root by inciſion, eſpecially that which comes from <hi>Antioch;</hi> that which comes out of <hi>Armenia</hi> is next; out of <hi>Europe,</hi> bad enough.</p>
                           <p>The beſt is nitid, ſplendid, clear like gum, ſomewhat white, rate, fungous, ſpongious, eaſily liqueſcible, tender, friable, not ponderous, nor very graveolent, nor yet ſuaveolent, but like taurine glew. And by how much any recedes more from theſe notes, by ſo much it is worſe.</p>
                           <p>All Scammony purges validly,
<note place="margin">Vires.</note> moving the belly with labour and moleſtation; it expurges flegm, and watry, thin and ſharp humours; and if it be too largely aſſumed, it abrades the inteſtines, hurts the bowels, opens and crodes the orifices of the veins, draws blood downwards, excites the dyſentery, conturbates the heart, liver, and other intrals, and ſubverts the ventricle; it is hot and dry in the third degree.</p>
                           <p>Its efferous faculty may be caſtigated by the admiſtion of Aloes,
<note place="margin">The correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Scam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.</note> but better if it be decocted in a Quince excavated, and roaſted upon coals, or in an oven, with ſome ſeeds of Smallage, Fennel, and <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus:</hi> but the moſt uſual correction is by the admiſtion of the juice of Quince, or Roſes.</p>

                           <p>ELlebore, or Hellebore, is either white, or black. There be two ſorts of white, the greater, and the leſſer; the greater bears leaves like Plantain, or rather Gentian, but larger, more veinous, skrewed and complicated. Its caul is ſtrait and long, emit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting many branches, out of which white flowers emerge. Its root is cepous, craſs, and white, whereunto many fibres adhere. It calefies and ſiccates in the third degree; it educes many, but chiefly pituitous humours, but not without moleſtation; it excites vomit in the Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and its powder adhibited at the noſtrils, moves ſternutation. Elleborine is very like that ſame the Pharmacopoliſts keep.</p>
                           <p>Black Hellebore is quadruple; the firſt ſort is the true Hellebore;
<note place="margin">Species nigri.</note> the ſecond, Garden Pſeudo-ellebore; the third, <hi>Dioſcorides</hi> his Hellebore, or Bears foot; the fourth is wild Pſeudo-ellebore. Some adde black ferulaceous Hellebore, and the great Elleboraſter.</p>
                           <p>The true black Hellebore emits broad, full, ſmooth, hard leaves,
<note place="margin">Elleborus niger verus.</note> like Laurel, whoſe ambient is incided: its flowers are broad, patu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, firſt albid, then purpureous; in whoſe middle, when they are ready to decide, grow ſhort husks, pregnant with ſmall ſeeds. Its root is manifold, diſterminated into many black fibres and radicles. It flouriſhes in the winter ſolſtice, and deep ſnows.</p>
                           <p>This ſort of Hellebore is moſt uſual among Medicks, and ſhould be uſurped, when Hellebore is put abſolutely and ſimply; which the Latines call <hi>Veratrum;</hi> the Arabians, <hi>Cherabachen.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>It purges Melancholy, and profits ſuch as are mad, frantick,
<note place="margin">Vires.</note> hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pochondriacal, ſplenical, epileptical, elephantical, and infeſted with a quartane feaver, conducing much to all diſeaſes proceeding from choler and melancholy: but it is perilous to the ſane, imbecil, and young.</p>

                           <p>THis Plant is a certain ſylveſtrian Cucurbite, by the Greeks and Latines called <hi>Colocynthis;</hi> by the Arabians, <hi>Landbel,</hi> and the Death of Plants; by the Perſians, <hi>Fel terrae,</hi> as that which ſuperates all other Plants in amaritude; and, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to <hi>Meſue,</hi> infects its neighbours poyſonouſly. It creeps out of the earth like ſative Cucurbite; its leaves are alſo like thereunto, ample and lanuginous; its branches long, and ſerpentine; its flowers of a dusky pale colour, like them of Cucumbers, whereof ſome dye preſently, producing no fruit; others ſuppeditate round apples in the form of an indifferent ball, very bitter, fungous, pithy, and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidated with ſeeds like them of Cucumbers; which at firſt are green, but when they have attained to Autumn, and their perfect magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, they are pale. They are alwayes very bitter, and kill not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the vicine Plants, but with aduſtion affect the earth about them, as <hi>Meſue</hi> relates at large, who writes much of <hi>Colocynthis;</hi> which I, thinking to be of ſmall moment, will not reſcribe.</p>
                           <p>It calefies and ſiccates in the third degree,
<note place="margin">Vires.</note> attracting pituitous and other craſs humours from all parts, as the brain, nerves, muſcles, and articles, though very remote. It purges Choler alſo, and often pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperouſly cures the colical colour, Apoplexy, Vertigo, Epilepſy, difficulty of breathing, and many other affections, which more cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Medicaments cannot help.

                           <p>There is a kinde of ſylveſtrian and erratical Cucumber,

                           <p>The juice drawn out of this, and coacted, makes the Elatery we ſpoke of before.</p>

<note place="margin">Widow-wail. Spurge-olive. Dwarf-bay.</note> Thymelaea, Chamelaea,</hi> and <hi>Chameleo niger. Thymelaea</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and <hi>Chamelaea,</hi> are affine both in form and nature. But black <hi>Chameleon</hi> differs from them both, for they are ſhrubby Plants, emitting tenuious, rigid, and ligneous branches, with ſmall leaves like Pomegranate leaves; but black <hi>Chameleon</hi> is of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of Thiſtles, bearing leaves like Artichoke, but leſſer, more te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuious, and ſpinous; whoſe root, according to <hi>Galen,</hi> is of a poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonous nature.</p>
                           <p>This Plant is called <hi>Mezereon</hi> by the Arabians, becauſe it is vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate; for <hi>Mezereon</hi> is as much as viduifical, or widow-making Plant, otherwiſe called the Lion of the earth, whoſe ſtalk is elevated about two cubits above the earth; its leaves are like them of an Olive, but greater; its grain is like Myrrhe.</p>
                           <p>The Commentators upon <hi>Meſue</hi> are altogether ignorant which is this Plant; but it ſeems to be ſome kinde of <hi>Chamelaea,</hi> eſpecially that which bearing three grains coherent, is called <hi>Tricoccos.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>And as in many kinds of Plants, ſome are familiar to us, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, others pernicious; ſo in the ſociety of <hi>Chamelaeas,</hi> one is effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, participating of ſome malign quality, which we call <hi>Mezereon,</hi> or <hi>Almezerion;</hi> another better, and leſs formidable, which may be ſafely exhibited in Medicine.</p>
                           <p>And it is called <hi>Chamelaea,</hi> or Spurge-Olive, for it is much like an Olive; a ſhrubby ſurculous Herb, with ſlender boughs about a cubit long, with leaves like an Olive tree, but leſſer, bitter, ſharp, and mordacious, affecting and ulcerating the tongue. Its fruit is ſmall, round, in the beginning green, afterwards red. The whole Plant is acrimonious, and of an aduſtive faculty;

                           <p>ZErumbet, or Zumbert, Zedoaria and Ginger are peregrine Plants of near cognation, but not all known to all men. For the Arabian <hi>Serapio</hi> (<hi>c.</hi> 172. <hi>l. de ſimpl.</hi>) from the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> ſaith, that Zerumbet and Zedoaria are one. Afterwards he aſſerts, that Zerumbet are round roots, like Ariſtolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, of the colour and ſapour of Ginger. And in another place (<hi>c.</hi> 271. <hi>ejuſd. libri</hi>) he writes, that it is a great tree in the Mountains of the Eaſt-Indies.</p>

<note place="margin">Arnabo, quid.</note> whereof <hi>Paulus Aeginus</hi> makes mention (<hi>c.</hi> 3. <hi>l.</hi> 6.) but they miſtake; for it is the opinion of many, that Arnabo is a tall tree, that is ſuaveolent; or as others think, that Arnabo is the name of a Plant that is now known by ſome other name.</p>
                           <p>But Zerumbet is a graminaceous Plant; either ſative,

                           <p>COſtus is a peregrine Plant celebrated by the Antients, but not accurately noted and deſcribed; ſo that its true dignotion is not apparent to the recent. All indeed ſay it is a root, but none yet indubitably aſſerted of what plant, or whether of one or more.</p>
                           <p>Yet if we believe the Antients,
<note place="margin">Species.</note> (as of neceſſity we muſt in ſuch things whereof they have had perfect knowledge, and which they have often uſed and approved) there are three ſorts of Coſtus, the Arabian, Indian, and Syrian.</p>
                           <p>The Arabian is white,
<note place="margin">Amarus &amp; dulcis.</note> light, and ſuaveolent above the reſt; while it is freſh and new, it is abundantly full and denſe, not carious.</p>
                           <p>The Indian is indeed light, but black and amare; the Syrian is flave, tuberous, to the guſt acrimonious, to the olfact fragrant. The Arabians conſtitute onely two ſorts thereof, the amare, and the ſweet. And <hi>Cluſius</hi> thinks there is but one kinde of Coſtus, and that it is onely called ſweet, in reference to the more amare and acrimonious. Such a difference as this in ſapour, we daily experience in Plants, which while freſh and new, are more ſweet and ſuave; when invete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, croded with worms, and corrupted, more amare, acrimonious, and inſuave.</p>
                           <p>The Coſtus now in uſe amongſt Phyſicians,
<note place="margin">Costus vulgaris</note> is a root almoſt like Ginger, within white, ſmooth, light, without palely flave, ſomewhat amare, very fragrant, and often ſo ſuaveolent while new, that it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunately affects the head. It grows in many places in <hi>India,</hi> as in <hi>Guzarat,</hi> and about <hi>Amadabar,</hi> the moſt famous City of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey. The Greeks and Latins retain the Arabian nomenclature, all calling it Coſt, or Goſtus.</p>

                           <p>The multiplicity of its denominations have much obſcured its di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnotion; for in <hi>Malago</hi> it is called <hi>Cais manis,</hi> that is, Sweet-wood; in <hi>Ormus, Drachint,</hi> by which word the Perſians and Arabians alſo denominate it. We call it ſometimes Caſſia, and Caſia, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſmall Cane, and ſometimes Cinnamon, that is, <hi>China</hi>'s <hi>Amome.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>But if we credit <hi>Garcias,</hi> who was an oculate faithfull Narrator,
<note place="margin">Species.</note> Caſſia, Cinnamon, and ſmall Cane, is one and the ſame Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Neither are there more ſorts of Cinnamon than two, one growing in <hi>Zeilan,</hi> the other in <hi>Malabar</hi> and <hi>Jaca.</hi> There are indeed ſive degrees of bonity in theſe two kinds.</p>
                           <p>The more craſs ſmall Cane is <hi>Xylocaſſia,</hi> or ligneous Caſſia,
<note place="margin">Caſſia Lignea. Cinnam. ver.</note> which the Arabians, Perſians and Indians call <hi>Salthaca.</hi> That which is more odorate, fragrant, and tenuious, is the true Cinnamon, which the odorate tree portends; and it is deſumed from the ſame ſhrub that ſmall Cane comes of. But Cinnamon is decerped from the trunk whoſe bark is moſt craſs, the ſmall Cane from its boughs. Which <hi>Theophraſtus</hi> ſeems to aim at, when he diſcerps it into many parts, aſſerting that the Cinnamon next the root is worſt, and leaſt odorate; the ſupream beſt, and moſt odorate; that in the middle, of a middle bonity.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Matthiolus</hi> cannot reſent this opinion of <hi>Theophraſtus,</hi> and others, who aſſert, that Caſſia and Cinnamon do not differ; he confeſſes, that Caſſia and ſmall Cane differ not, but that Cinnamon differs from both, and cannot be found; and if it could be found, that its wood as well as its bark would be of uſe to Medicks.</p>
                           <p>But notwithſtanding his authority, we have very good Cinna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon; and it differs not from ſmall Cane, or ſweet Caſſia, ſave in ſome degrees of bonity; and thus muſt the varieties enumerated by <hi>Dioſcorides</hi> be accepted. And, they ſpeak very probably and ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, who aſſert that <hi>Xylocaſſia,</hi> or ſmall Cane, is the moſt craſs and extrmſecal cortex, Cinnamon the more interiour, tenuious, odorate, better, and more commodious for uſe.</p>
                           <p>In <hi>Galen</hi>'s time Cinnamon was ſo rare, that onely Emperours poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed it, who kept it among their Treaſures; but its excellency hath now cauſed it to be brought plenteouſly to us from peregrine Regions.</p>
                           <p>Cinnamon-tree is wild and ſpontaneous, about the magnitude of an Olive-tree, with many and ſtrait boughs, leaves of Orange-colour, in the form of Bay-leaves, white flowers, black and round fruit, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the bigneſs of little Olives.</p>
                           <p>Its eximious virtue is in its bark, which calefies, concocts,
<note place="margin">Vires.</note> acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerates flowers and birth, and exceedingly recreates the heart.</p>
                           <pb n="278" facs="tcp:37350:182"/>
                           <p>There is another ſort of Cinnamon tree, very much like this in form, whoſe odour, ſapour and virtue conſiſts not in the bark, as in the Eaſt-Indian tree, but in the fruit onely, as <hi>Cluſiue</hi> relates out of <hi>Nicolaus Monardus</hi> (<hi>e.</hi> 25. <hi>l. ſimpl.</hi>)</p>

                              <hi>INdia</hi> affords us a certain aromatical Nut, which from its ſuaveo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence is called <hi>Moſchocaryon, Moſchocarydion, Caryon aromati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum, Nux myriſtica,</hi> and <hi>Nutmeg.</hi> It is excerped from a pere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grine tree, about the magnitude of a Pear tree, with leaves like <hi>Perſica,</hi> but ſhorter, red flower, and peramene odour.</p>
                           <p>This tree was unknown to the Antients, eſpecially to the Greeks. It grows in the Iſland <hi>Banda,</hi> where it is called <hi>Palla, Mace,</hi> and <hi>Buna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palla.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The fruit of this tree is for its ſuaveolence called <hi>Nux moſchata,</hi> yet it ſmells not of Moſch; and it is circumveſted with two ſhells, the one, to wit, the exteriour, is moſt craſs, which gapes when it is mature, as we ſee Wallnuts covers; the other is next the Nut, which is more tenuious, which being of a red colour, ſhews moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently through the chinks of the exteriour bark.</p>
                           <p>And that ſame tenuious involument is Mace, which dehiſces alſo when the Nut is exſiccated, and acquires a golden colour inſtead of its red. Mace then is a thin membrane of a flave colour, which co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers and complects the Nutmeg.</p>
                           <p>Now Mace and Macir differ; for Mace is the hull of a Nut, and Macir the craſs flave, or as <hi>Pliny</hi> ſaith, red bark of a certain wood brought from <hi>Barbary,</hi> bitter to the guſt, and aſtrictive; of which tree we can learn no certain knowledge neither from the antient nor late Writers; and hence we gather, that Macir is not well known.</p>
                           <p>A freſh, heavy, and fat Nutmeg, which at the prick of a needle emits an olcous juice, is beſt, and moſt approved.</p>

                           <p>MAny diſſimilar Plants are denominated Peppers, as white,
<note place="margin">Species.</note> black, and long Pepper, Calecutian alſo, or Pepper of <hi>India,</hi> and watry Pepper, or Perſian; yea ſome have called <hi>Vitex,</hi> or <hi>Agnus caſta,</hi> and <hi>Ribes,</hi> wild black Pepper. But when Pepper is put abſolutely, <hi>Garcias</hi> admoniſhes Apothecaries to ſelect the white as beſt; for want of which, ours de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome black.</p>
                           <p>The Plant that bears white Pepper differs ſo little from that which bears black, that they are the very ſame to ſenſe; both are ſcanſive, and ſo imbecil and caduce, that unleſs they be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propped, their lent and flexile branches will delabe to the earth, like Hop-trees, or Wood bind. And they are either upholden by ſome fulciment, or ſown at the root of ſome tree, to whoſe top they aſcend by convolution. Their leaves are rare, their roots ſmall, their fruits ſmall, round, and racemouſly coherent.</p>
                           <p>All Pepper is calefactive,
<note place="margin">Vires.</note> but the white is more potent and odo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate than the black; but as the Plant is rare, ſo is its fruit. There is Pepper with a caul, of which in its place.</p>
                           <p>The Plant that bears long Pepper is no congruent to the former in effigies than in faculties, according to <hi>Cluſius,</hi>
                              <note place="margin">Long Pepper.</note> though <hi>Garcias</hi> makes them very diſſident Plants, for their leaves are equal in magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, both hederaceous, but withall nervous, annexed to a ſhort pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicle. The fruit of this Plant very much reſembles thoſe grains that grow on Hazle-trees; they iſſue out of every ſpace betwixt knots oppoſite againſt the pedicles of the leaves, as in other Pepper trees. Theſe fruits conſiſt of many grains, elegantly compoſed according to the longitude of their pedicle. They are green, becauſe they are collected before their maturity, and ſometimes longer, ſometimes ſhorter, as it happens in other fruits not yet come to their perfect growth.</p>
                           <p>Macro-Pepper, according to <hi>Dioſcorides,</hi> (<hi>c.</hi> 189. <hi>l.</hi> 2.)
<note place="margin">Macro-piperis vires.</note> is very mordaceous; and becauſe it is decerped before its maturity, it is ſomewhat amare; it is a good ingredient for Antidotes, and theria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Medicaments.</p>

                           <p>This fruit, while green, ſuperates all others in ſuavity; it empts out of the extremity of the branches like a nail, whence the vulgari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty call it a Cyroflcous nail; for it better reſembles a nail than a out, as its name depotes, for <hi>Garyophillum</hi> is a Nut-leaf.</p>

Its flowers are like the ſmall luteous Jaſmine, to which a ſmall, aromatical, ſucculent, flave, mordaceous and acrimonious ſeed follows, which ſmells like
<note n="*" place="margin">Opobalſamum</note> Balm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gum, and is called Carpobalſame.</p>
                           <p>This Plant is full of branches even to the root, whoſe ſurcles are very ſlender, fulve, odorate, aſperated with many knots, and ſmells like Balm-oil.</p>
                           <p>When they are well grown, they abſcind theſe branches, and ſell them to Merchants, who carry them into forreign Countryes for lucre ſake, for they are very expetible and vendible in any place; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of their eximious faculties, Medicks call them <hi>Xylobalſamum.</hi>

                           <p>Medicks have invented three ſuccidaneous Vicegerents for the want of theſe three; for Carpobalſame, Cubebs; for Xylobal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſame, new and freſh Lentisk; and for Opobalſame, the Oil of Cloves and Nutmeg, as alſo the limpid water of Turpentine tree, thin as Oil; for Turpentine is the very Mother of artificial Balms, the parts of whoſe Plants reſpond well to the parts of natural Balm.</p>

                           <p>MAny Plants will onely grow in the Meridional, others in the Septentrional, and ſome in both regions; as that ſame grain which the Mauritanians call <hi>Kermes;</hi> which very denomination, according to <hi>Dioſcorides,</hi> demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates the Plant to be exotical, and to grow in <hi>Aſia, Armenia,</hi> or <hi>Arabia;</hi> for in two uſurpations it reſerves its Arabian nomencla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to wit, in the confection of <hi>Alkermes,</hi> and in dying cloaths of a Bermeſian colour.</p>
                           <p>Now <hi>Kermes,</hi> or <hi>Karmas,</hi> is the name of a ſuffruticeous Plant,
<note place="margin">Kermes ſeu Karmas, quid.</note> and its grain, which is vulgarly called Scarlet dye, or infectory grain.</p>
                           <p>It grows both in the aforeſaid places, and in <hi>Orleans</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> and many places in <hi>Italy</hi> which are hot, and tend towards the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenancan Sea; and it is repoſed amongſt the aculeous Ilices; for their variety is manifold; whereof ſome are glandiſerous, which grow into tall trees; others coccigerous, which are lower; ſome bacciferous, which are of a middle conſiſtency, as
<note n="*" place="margin">Holly.</note> Aquifoyl, which is frequent and vivacious in the Septentrional ſoyl. Yet ſome exclude this Plant from the number of Ilices, although the two for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer have not ſo much affinity each with other, as the later with this.</p>
                           <pb n="284" facs="tcp:37350:185"/>
                           <p>The Plant then whereon <hi>Kermes</hi> grows, is a certain ſmall Illex, putting forth many cauls, which are harder towards the root, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenebrated with leaves continually green, long, jagged about, denſe, ſinuous, angulous, ſpinous, aculeated, and horrid, which at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Spring conceives as it were a little egge towards its root, which it obvallates with pricks ſupernally devolved, which in its growth changes its colour from white to cineritious, then to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and at laſt acquires a moſt elegant colour: for the whole grain is full of ſanguineous liquor, which after perfect maturity, and too long coaction in its membrane, produces worms, whereof ſome are winged,
<note place="margin">Succus Kermes</note> and fly away: yet before the procreating of them, the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor may be ſtudiouſly extracted, to the confection of <hi>Alkermet,</hi> and ſcarlet tincture.</p>
                           <p>The generation of theſe little Animals, or may be hindred, or their death procured, by the aſperſion of a little vinegar, whereby their exanimated carcaſſes are collected, and coacted into a maſs, like Vermilion, which they call
<note n="*" place="margin">Sceachul.</note> 
                              <hi>Scaletium;</hi> and <hi>Pliny, Cuſculium,</hi> for the tincture of purple, or skarlet colour.</p>
                           <p>This grain is not the fruit, but excrement of this Illex; or a red and lucid gum contained in a husk, which grows about the root of the leaves. This Illex is not onely coccigerous, but glandiferous alſo; for the more inveterate ſurcles bring forth Acorns ſomewhat longer and blacker than thoſe of the Oaks, but then it ceaſes to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce grains,
<note place="margin">Coccum Baph.</note> or * <hi>Coccum.</hi> And therefore theſe ſurcles are preſcin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that a new ſpring of ſurcles may follow, and be coccife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous.</p>

                              <hi>Kermes</hi> exceedingly roborates the heart,

                           <p>This root is now vulgar; which the Antients either knew not, or oſcitantly pretermitted; but now it is ſo notorions, that no Barber, or young Apprentice, but he will talk thereof.

                           <p>MUſtard is no Aliment, ſometimes a Medicament, often a Condiment; for it is moſt conveniently admixed to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcid and glutinous diſhes, eſpecially in winter, that their vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcidity may be corrected, and the ventricle thereby roborated; for it admirably helps ſuch as have dull palats, and nauſeate their meat. But becauſe by its acrimony it importunely affects the guſt, it is not onely grinded with vinegar, to mitigate its fervour, but mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſweet wine, to obdulcorate its acrimony; and ſo is made a gratefull Condiment, which many for its vulgarity diſeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate.</p>
                           <p>Muſtard is either ſative or ſpontaneous;
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> the ſative is of two ſorts, the one hath leaves like Rape, but leſſer, and more ſharp, with a round, hiſpid, ſharp ſtalk, of two cubits height, or more, brachiated with many boughs, about which erupt luteous flowers orderly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſed, to which long, thin and ſharp husks ſucceed, wherein a little round ſeed is included, of a yellow colour, and mordaceous guſt.</p>
                           <p>The other ſative Muſtard is ſo like the former,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> that they ſeem onely to diſſent in colour of their ſeeds; which in the former is luteous, in this a blackiſh red; the leaves of this are ſomewhat more like Rocket than the other, in all other things they are the ſame.</p>
                           <p>The wild grows ſpontaneouſly in any dry place, and ſometimes in humid places, brinks, and hedges; it is leſs than the former, bearing
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:37350:189"/>leſſer leaves, jagged, almoſt like Shepherds-purſe, but more acute; it emits luteous quadrifolious flowers; it afterwards puts forth its ſeed in husks, which it varies, ſometimes bearing white, ſometimes red ſeed.</p>
                           <p>This Plant denominates a noble Medicament they call <hi>Synapiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum,</hi> which is celebrated to many uſes, as to inveterate Head-achs, Epilepſy, Vertigo, difficulty of breathing, diſtillations, and the Gout.</p>
                           <p>Muſtard is hot and dry in the fourth degree; it incides, attenuates,

                           <p>MUſtard and <hi>Thlaſpi</hi> are rightly deſcribed in the ſame ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; for both agree, if not in effigies, yet much in qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities; ſo that <hi>Thlaſpi</hi> is commonly called Countrey,
<note place="margin">Species.</note> or Treacle-Muſtard. There are many kinds of <hi>Thlaſpis,</hi> whereof three are moſt noted, one greater, another leſſer, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other mean, whereunto all the reſt of that name are referred.</p>
                           <p>The firſt grows plentifully both in cultivated and incultivated Fields, with large, long, criſped leaves, acute towards the end; its caul is about half a foot long, emitting boughs, circumcinged with flowers, at firſt white, which are frequent at the beginning of Summer, not unlike Shepherds-purſe, which convolving themſelves into two valvuls, produce a blackiſh, hot, and ſharp ſeed, in ſapour like Muſtard, or <hi>Naſturtium.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The ſecond hath a ramous caul of a foot high; its leaves are leſſer, anguſt, acuminated, and ſubverted; its flowers white, ſeed ſmall, ſharp and hot, like <hi>Naſturtium.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The third and leſs <hi>Thlaſpi</hi> is an Herb with anguſt leaves, of a fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers length, converting themſelves downwards, and a little incided in their extremities; its flowers are whitiſh, caul ſlender and ramous, of a foot high, whereon many ſmall, plain husks, like little Lentils on ſmall pedicles, do depend in an excellent ſeries; wherein a ſmall ſeed, affecting the mouth and tongue with a ſharp ſapour like Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtard, is encloſed.</p>
                           <p>It grows in incultivated, ſtony, mountainous, hot and dry places, as on many walls and houſes; whence ſome Herbaliſts call it <hi>Tecto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium Naſturtium,</hi> and ſometimes Countrey-Muſtard. Its ſeed is uſed in Antidotes; yet he ſhall not much erre, that in defect thereof uſurps other ſeeds.</p>

                           <p>Its ſeed is not and dry in the fourth degree; it breaks impoſtumes, moves flowers, kills the young in the uterus, helps the ſciatical; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>funded at the fundament, it evacuates blood, and pollicitates many more commodities, if rightly and opportunely uſurped.

                           <p>It riſes a cubit high, with anguſt, long leaves, lacinated on both ſides with deep, but rare inciſures, with palid, and ſometimes hue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and quadrifolious flowers; ſeed like Turnep ſeed, and a white and dure root; it grows ſometimes ſpomaneouſly among branches, and other rough and incultivated places.</p>
                           <p>There is alſo erratical and wild Rocket, which grows in ſqualid places near high wayes, and town walls, with leaves like Sow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiſtles, but more ſlender and ſmall; with flowers of a luteous co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, like them of <hi>Braſſica,</hi> which erupt in the middle of Summer.</p>

                           <p>THere are two general differences of Nettles,
<note place="margin">Species.</note> one whoſe leaves are improbouſly mordacious, and ſurcle hurting the contrectants hands with its pungent down; the other innoxious, which may be handled without moleſtation. The former is by the Greeks called ſometimes <hi>Acalyphe,</hi> becauſe it is injucund to the tact; ſometimes <hi>Cnide,</hi> becauſe it punges morda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly, commonly called Quick-Nettle; the other is called <hi>Lami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> and <hi>Anonium,</hi> as alſo white, or dead Nettle.</p>
                           <p>There be alſo three ſorts of quick Nettles, the two greater, and one leſſer, all wild and ſpontaneous. Some call theſe wild ones, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſculine and ſeminine Nettles, as ſuperating one another in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity.</p>
                           <p>The Romanes call that Maſculine in the firſt place, which emits round ſurcles of half a cubits height, and ſometimes longer, cave, and hollow, with broad, mucronated, ſimbrious, criſped leaves, rough and mordaceous on both ſides, which by their contact excite lumps and uſtion, and rubefy the skin. The ſeed is included in ſmall pills, round and hiſpid, which proceed out of the root of the leaves.</p>
                           <p>That Feminine in the ſecond, which produces ſeed not globular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but racemouſly, like Grape cluſters, after the manner of the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minine Mercury; its caul is higher, and more ramous; its leaves broader, and all its parts mordacious.</p>
                           <p>The third ſort is the leaſt, and yet moſt ramous, mordacious, and graveolent, producing its ſeed racemouſly, but not after the manner of the former; for many grains erupt out of the ſurcie at the foot of the leaves together, but each one hath a pedicle like the maſculine Nettle. This third ſort is called Dog-Nettle, and is moſt of all mordaeious.</p>
                           <p>They all grow in incultivated places, about hedges, dams, and old walls, and ſometimes in Gardens, and in fat ſoyls.</p>
                           <p>All Nettles ſiccate exceedingly, but calefie not ſo much; for though <hi>Urtica</hi> be <hi>ab urendo,</hi> Nettle from burning, yet they are not uſtive from their heat, but by canſing ſuch a pain from their pungent down: for (<hi>Macer. c.</hi> 2. <hi>l.</hi> 2.) Nettles decocted are very ignavely hot, they help the orthopnoical, moves urine and flowers; their feed ſtimulates to venery, and is a preſent Antidote againſt the poyſon of Hemlock. It helps alſo againſt the malignant quality of Henbane, Muſhromes, and Quick-filver, as alſo the bitings of Serpents, and poyſonous Beaſts. The ſeed of the maſcuſſine Nettle is thought beſt.</p>
                           <pb n="296" facs="tcp:37350:191"/>
                           <p>Here we may not omit,
<note place="margin">To help thoſe that are ſlung with Nettles.</note> that Oil conduces much to the eaſe of thoſe puſtuls and dolours excitated by Nettles; as alſo Elder leaves bruiſed and adhibited, which by a ſpecial propriety reſpect this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
                           <p>Many other Plants are repoſed amongſt Nettles, which are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times called <hi>Lamia,</hi> ſometimes dead Nettles; whereunto another Plant is referred, which the Romanes call <hi>Labio,</hi> which ſome think is <hi>Agripalma,</hi> or Cardiack; others, <hi>Galeopſis,</hi> and <hi>Galeobdolon.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The firſt ſort of theſe dead Nettles are thoſe that aſſurge to a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bital procerity with Nettle leaves, ſoft, and criſped, ſometimes of a whitiſh, ſometimes reddiſh colour.</p>
                           <p>The ſecond very like the former, but not ſo ramous, with flowers like Spurge, but purpureous, iſſuing out of the genicles of its ſurcles.</p>
                           <p>The third is leſſer, more imbecil and fetid, with rounder leaves, which is ſeldome, if at all uſed in Medicinal Confections. Some now of late make a ſyrup of the flowers of other Nettles for the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of the lungs and breaſt, which they call <hi>Syrupus de Lamis:</hi> but its effect doth not celebrate it.</p>

                           <p>ENulacampane puts forth leaves from its very root, which are long, late, mucronated, hiſpid, and numerous; its caul is hard, of three cubits length, or more; its flowers are aure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and ſtellated like Oxe-eye, or Flea-bane, which turn into knaps, the ſeed, which is like Thiſtle-ſeed, remaining.</p>
                           <p>Its root is great, craſs, flave, odorate, and ſuaveolent; it grows in fat and humid places; the beſt is brought from <hi>Helena,</hi> where the Poets feign that it ſprung up from <hi>Helena</hi>'s tears, whence it had its name. Some ſay, <hi>Helena</hi> ſowed it there to kill Serpents; for it is very efficacious againſt poyſons, not onely ſuch as infect men, but alſo and chiefly ſuch as harm beaſts; for given to Sheep in wine and vinegar, it keeps them from, and cures them in the peſtilence, whereunto they are obnoxious, which the Vulgar call <hi>Clavelate.</hi>

Its roots are round, nodous, long, implicated one amongſt another, and reptant like graſs roots, blackiſh without, and ſubluteouſly white within, which are odorate, pleaſant, and amare.

                           <p>When the leaves of Scilla are marcid, its Caule aſſurges to the height of a Cubit, with white flowers iſſuing out of its midle like ſtrawberry-flowers, which from thence pullulate to its very ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity; ſhort, triangular and compreſſed huskes follow theſe, gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidated with black and full ſeed.</p>

                              <hi>Bulbus</hi> is a certain root, corticous, ſhort, round, and tunicated with many membranes, the moſt external whereof is greateſt; it often growes out of the earth, producing ſome ſlender radicles like capillaments, which keeping in the earth attract convenient ſucce for the nutriment of the whole <hi>Bulbus.</hi>

                           <p>Condited Satyria are analeptical, and reſtaurative; they are good for ſuch as are tabid, and ſuch as frequently exerciſe venery: for the root of <hi>Satyrium</hi> is thought ſo potent in exciting venery, that by retenſion in ones hand, it will ſtimulate them to congreſſe; whence the Greeks deſign all plants by the nomenclature of <hi>Saty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion,</hi> which excite venery.</p>

                           <p>They have round heads on their ſummities; out of which iſſue flowers of a whitiſh red and purpureous colour, which with the whole Plant are ſuaveolent.</p>
                           <p>Another kind of ſerpyll is found in many places which is not Serpentine as the reſt, but large and wild which the ſhopmen call Montanous, Penny-royall.</p>

                           <p>Serpill is acrimonious and hot, moves floures and Urine, abates the gripeings of the belly, conduces in the Lethargy, cures the biteing of poiſonous beaſts, and by its fume when it is burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed repells Serpents.</p>

                           <p>The firſt delights in ſqualid tuberous and montanous places, and is called Mountain-<hi>Calaminth,</hi> which for its elegant effigies and grateful odour, is now cicurated in Gardens; as alſo all kind of Mints, to which it reſponds after a manner both in faculties and nomenclature; for <hi>Calaminth</hi> portends fair Minth, and this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex name denotes its nobility.</p>
                           <p>The ſecond ſort of Calaminth hath leafs like Pennyroyal, but ſometimes greater, whether variegated with ſpots, with whitely purpureous flowers amicting its cubital branches, it delights in aprike places, and is found in many fields when the ſegetives are demeſſed; it is alſo called <hi>Nepeta</hi> in <hi>Dioſcorides,</hi> who yet neither approves nor diſapproves of the name.</p>

                           <p>All Mugworts are Sylveſtrian, the firſt whereof is latifolious, lacinious, and marginally diſſected; with ſtreight, round, ſtria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted bicubital cauls, and ſmall flowers like Wormwood: it growes by way-ſides, and oftentimes in the middle of Gardens.</p>

                           <p>Some make but three varieties of <hi>Doronicum,</hi> which ſeem ſole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to diſcrepate in magnitude. <hi>Cluſius</hi> enumerates ſeven; amongſt which, <hi>Damaſonion,</hi> which moſt call <hi>Aliſma,</hi> is comprehended: and Claſſicall Authors affirm, that the root of <hi>Damaſonion</hi> may well be ſubſtituted for the root of common <hi>Doronicum,</hi> in the confection of the Electuary <hi>de gemmis,</hi> and other cordiall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds; for it is commended againſt poyſons, whether ingeſted or inflicted by <hi>Dioſcorides,</hi> (<hi>C.</hi> 69. <hi>L.</hi> 3.) whereby it ſeems more convenient for theſe concoctions then <hi>Doronicum,</hi> of whoſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties ſome doubt; others ſpeak little.</p>

                           <p>The third ſort is, as it were, one Plant growing upon another, no part of the ſame; the earth brings it not forth, nor yet is it produced by ſature, but fruticates and growes upon an aliene Plant, whoſe leafe-fades not, nor vigour failes: it growes not onely on one <hi>Tree,</hi> but many very diſſimilar, as Oakes, Apple-Trees whether domeſtick or wild, Willowes, Poplar and many more.</p>
                           <p>Theſe very ſeldome exceed a cubit in heighth, but they extend themſelves laterally, with many ſhort, geniculated, ligneous and dilutely green boughs, with long, broad, ſtriated and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what flave leafes; round, white and ſplended berries grow on their genicles; whereon Thruſhes, Stock-Doves and the like, feed in Winter. They have no roots unleſſe the fibres and boughs of the Viſcigerous Trees be their roots.

                           <p>It calefies with ſome acritude and amarity; yet it is of that rank of ſimples which requires ſome time before it exerts its ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactive quality.

                           <p>I Hitherto thought that all that I heard of <hi>Mandrakes</hi> were no more then old Wifes fables, yet I now find that theſe figments have been depromed from the writings of ſome of the ancients, who being too credulous have committed to preſſe what the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perite ſomniated: for ſome of the Greeks named this root <hi>Circea</hi> becauſe they Judged it ſome <hi>Philthrum</hi> conducing to love-mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. <hi>Phythagoras</hi> called it <hi>Anthropomorphon</hi> becauſe it in ſome wiſe repreſented mans Trunk and Members, and becauſe its roots were frequently geminell, reſembling two Leggs, and two Buttocks; in alluſion to which name the ſeptentrionall idiome calls it <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dragora, Man</hi> denoting a man, and <hi>Draghen</hi> in that Language mans form: but all theſe are fabulous and fictitious, whereby running circulatours deceive the incautious, circumducing a bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidous root, whereon they have inſculpted a humane ſhape and diſcriminated members.

                           <p>Some call it the dogs Apple-Tree, others the earths Apple-Tree, becauſe it bears round luteous Apples like the yolks of hard eggs which are odorate, but venenate withall.</p>
                           <p>There are two ſorrs thereof, the one maſculine or white, which the Greeks call <gap reason="foreign">

                           <p>The other faeminine or black, which emitts more anguſt leafes like Lettice but leſſer, ſomwhat hirſute and procumbent; it beares Apples like the maſculine, but leſſer and lutrouſly palleſcent: it hath often two or three roots, mutually convolved and intorted, which are black without, white within, carnoſe, long and craſſe.</p>

                              <hi>Mandrake</hi> is very impatient of ſolar heat, it fruticates beſt in umbrous and aprique places; whence many learned authours think its derive its nomenclature, becauſe it delights in <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dris,</hi> that is, in Caves and Dens.</p>
                           <p>In <hi>Dioſcorides</hi> his time the ſucce of <hi>Mandrake</hi> was collected, which concreted by inſolation was of much uſe, now we onely uſe its Roots and Leafes, and them very ſeldome, and onely in ſuch affections as contemne more gentle ſtupefactives.</p>
                           <p>An oyle may be extracted out of its Apples by infuſion, as we have ſhewed in our officine; which prudently adhibited will take away any dolour and conciliate ſleepe.</p>

                              <hi>Mandrake</hi> is ſeldome aſſumed at the mouth; but ſome other ſoporiferous medicament, duely caſtigated, which would with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out danger conſopite the ſenſes, ſhould be given in its ſtead to ſuch as would be burned or cutt in any part without ſenſe of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour: for <hi>Mandrake</hi> is not onely impenſely cold,

<note place="margin">Morella</note> whence the french call it Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rella, the ſhopmen Solatrum, and the Greeks <hi>Strychion.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>It is a pedall and racemous Plant, with leafes like oxymum, but greater; black berryes, racemouſly coherent, which at firſt are green, after maturity, black; purpureous and elegant flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers praecede theſe, out of whoſe middle erupts a luteous and ſpecious tuft</p>
                           <pb n="346" facs="tcp:37350:215"/>
                           <p>It is exceedingly refrigerative, and therefore cures the Wild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fire and Head-aches from a hot cauſe; it helpes a hot Stomack its berries are acceſſary to the unguent of Diapompholigos; its ſtillatious liquor cures the inflammation of the eyes and ardour of other parts, and being ſtupefactive conciliates ſleep.</p>
                           <p>There is another dormitory <hi>Nightſhade</hi> which is exceedingly ſoporiferous, it is a ramous Plant, with hard fruit, many large leafes, ſomwhat hirſute, and effigiated like them of Quince-Trees its root is red without, and whitiſh when it is dry; its flower is large ſomwhat red, and of an ingratefull aſpect, out of whoſe ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, a round fruit, about the magnitude of a Cherry emerges, which preſently kills its introſumers; it is more ſoporiferous then opium it ſelf; it fruticates in many wild and incultivated places, eſpecially in banks not farre diſtant from the ſea, whence botanicks call it marine <hi>Nightſhade;</hi> ſhopmen, Solatrum.</p>

                           </p>
                           <p>The greater <hi>Comfrey,</hi> which from the ſimilitude of its leafes is called Aſſes eare, hath a cubitall caule, ample, long, broad craſſe and hiſpid leafes like Bugloſſe, but broader, more obſcure and mucronated; out of the wings of its ſurcles erupt productions of Leafes, wherein white pallid or ſubrubeous flowers grow, which are diſpoſed in an elegant order, whereunto black ſeeds like them of petty Mullein do ſucceed; its root is glutinous, black without, white within, whereof there is frequent uſe in <hi>Pharmacy.</hi>

                           <p>The maculated <hi>Comfrey</hi> which moſt call <hi>Pulmonary</hi> or Lung-wort hath branches, leafes, and flowers like the praecedent, onely its leafes are ſhorter, and maculated with white ſpots, it growes in wooddy, opaque, and umbrous places, and it is thought good a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the vices of the Lungs.</p>
                           <p>The <hi>Petraean Comfrey</hi> which is ſo called becauſe it growes in <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous</hi> and ſtony places, erects it ſelfe with ſmall and ſlender branches like Origanum; with ſmall Leafes, heads like Thyme; and a ruddy, long, and craſſe root, ſome think that this Sympythum is Bugle, but being lignous and odorated and capitulated like thyme, it differs much from Bugle.</p>
                           <p>Bugle is a certain middle kind of Sympythum; of which the paſt age knew, and praedicated many and admirable things: the vulgarity yet perſwading themſelves, that they need neither Medick, nor Chirurgeon that have bugle, which they thence call Sanikle; its leafes are craſſe, long, ſmall, mucronated, incided a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, and ſubrubrous, its caules quadrangular, and ſomewhat
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:37350:218"/>hirſute; its flowers caeruleous, and many even from the middle of the ſurcles upwards: ſome call it <hi>Morandola;</hi> ſome, <hi>Lauren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tina;</hi> and others, the middle Comfrey: it is a vulnerary, and is much commended to diſrupted, broken, bruiſed and convelled members.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Prunella</hi> or <hi>Brunella,</hi> which ſome adde to the Tribe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freys, is a low plant, with ſlender, quadrangular, hirſute and decumbent ſurcles; broad, mucronated, but ſhort, ſomewhat hiſpid, obſcurely virid, viſcid and fat leaves; caeruleouſly pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pureous flowers, erupting out of the ſummities of its ſurcles, in ears like Betony flowers, it is good for the ſame, that <hi>Bugle</hi> polli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citates; it deleates the blackneſſe of the tongue contracted by Feavers, if the mouth be waſhed with its decoction.</p>

                           <p>Sorrel is ſufficiently known to all; and it is of two ſorts,
<note place="margin">Species.</note> the one wild, which is leaſt, and moſt acid; growing copiouſly in ſabulous, macilent, and ſegetary places; which the <hi>Hollanders</hi> call <hi>Acetoſa vervecina;</hi> other, <hi>Vineta.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The other is greater, which delights in humid places, as in Meadowes, and many Gardens, whereof there are two varieties, one alwayes hortenſian and reptant, very diſſimilar to the reſt in effigies; for its leafs are round, and its colour ſubcineritiouſly virid; its ſapour indeed is acid like the reſt, but more grateful to the palate: the other is well known, which is underſtood al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes when Sorrel is put abſolutely; this is from its great and ſacred effects called ſometimes ſacred or holy graſſe.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Oxalis</hi> brings to my mind the herb <hi>Oxytriphilum,</hi> or ſower tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foile, which the vulgarity calls Cuckow-bread; the Apothecaries, <hi>Alleluga; &amp; Fracaſtorius, Lugula:</hi> it is a low plant growing in the beginning of the Spring in ſylvous places, with ſlender and ſhort Caulicles, on whoſe ſummities three, tenuious, virid, acid, and grateful leafs do inſide; its flowers conſiſting of white leafs coherent, do depend on ſhort pedicles; this little herb recreates the heart, exarceates putretude, and refrigerates; its water di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilled helps in continual and peſtilent Feavers.</p>

                              <hi>Hepatica</hi> is often called <hi>Lichen</hi> either becauſe it is the beſt reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy againſt Ring Wormes,

It is called <hi>primula ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> or <hi>Primeroſe,</hi> becauſe it flouriſhs and germinates as ſoon as the very ſpring approaches: there are three generall differences thereof, the hortenſian, pratenſian, and nemorall; the hortenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an or garden <hi>Primeroſe</hi> is either ſimple, or multiflorous, both their flowers are either green or luteouſly pallid; they that grow in Meadowes and Woods are alike as to leafes, diſſimilar in flowers, for the pratenſian flowers are croceous, ſmall, and almoſt inodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, the nemoralls pallid more patulous and odorate.</p>

                           <p>I have noted ſix varietyes differenced by the colour of their flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers, for ſome are herbaceous green and elegant, others white and vetuſt; ſome red; others aureous, and others ſubflave; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides ſome are onely coronated with a ſimple flower,
<note place="margin">Paralyſis.</note> others are ſo prolifically multiflorous, that one flower ſeems to grow out of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, that which produces a ſimple and luteous flower, growes copiouſly and ſpontaneouſly, in many places in the lower <hi>Neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtria,</hi> eſpecially in the Vallonian field, where many rare Plants make their provent.</p>

                           <p>THis Tree commonly called <hi>Granate,</hi> and its fruit <hi>Pomegranate</hi> derives its denomination either from the multitude of graines wherewith it is referted, or elſe from the region of <hi>Grana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta</hi> where it fruticates copiouſly; it delights in hot aire and dry ground, its leafes are like myrtle leafes, which fall off annually, its flower is red, oblong, jucund of aſpect, and reſembles a cup in effigies, the vulgar call it <hi>Balauſtium,</hi> though that name, in <hi>Dioſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rides</hi> his opinion, may rather be deduced to the wild ones.</p>
                           <p>There are two ſorts of <hi>Pomegranate-Trees,</hi> the one wild, which is florigerous, but withall infrugiferous, the other domeſticall, whereof there are three differences, one beares acid <hi>Pomegranates,</hi> another ſweet ones; and the third dulco-acid ones, all of them are angulous and craſſe, referted with many graines, demerged in much juice.</p>

                           <p>WHat <hi>Lacca,</hi> and what <hi>Cancamum</hi> are, whether they be both one or diſtinct, and what each of them is, doeth not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare by the writings of Authours. <hi>Serapio, Paulus,</hi> and <hi>Matthiolus</hi> believe that <hi>Lacca</hi> is that which <hi>Dioſcorides</hi> calls <hi>Cancamum. Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſavolus, Garcias ab horto,</hi> and <hi>Cluſius</hi> think it is a diſtinct thing, who being deſirous to find out the truth have luſtrated various tracts of the world, and think that <hi>Lacca</hi> is not only diſtinct from <hi>Canca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum,</hi> but alſo unknown: for ſeeing it is only uſed for perfumes, and we have many more fragrant and ſuaveolent <hi>Thymiamata,</hi> it hath not been ſo diligently ſought after; moreover being exoticall, the Tree from which it delabes, growing, as it is thought, in <hi>Arabia,</hi> our Merchants have not deigned it worth the ſearch and portage: however it is a kind of <hi>Gum,</hi> of a virous ſapour, ſweet odour, and rare uſe. Now <hi>Lacca</hi> is deſtitute of both theſe qualityes frequently invented, neither the <hi>Arabian</hi> Chermes, nor the ſucce of Sorbe-Tree, nor Medlar-Tree; nor yet like Myrrhe, as <hi>Avicenna</hi> writes, who it may be knew it not; but if <hi>Garcias de horto</hi> may be credited it is a kind of Favago, and concreted liquor, on the boughs of a vaſt Tree, coacted by the ſucking and help of winged Ants.</p>
                           <p>And this Tree growes not in <hi>Arabia,</hi> but in <hi>India,</hi> eſpecially in the province of <hi>Pegu,</hi> where <hi>Lacca</hi> is called <hi>Trec,</hi> as alſo in <hi>Benga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la</hi> and <hi>Malavar,</hi> where it is called <hi>Loc</hi> and <hi>Lac. Garcias</hi> indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to eſtabliſh and confirme this opinion by reaſon and much Hiſtory, ſtriving alſo to prove out of <hi>Amatus Luſitanus,</hi> that <hi>Cancamum</hi> is an <hi>Aroma,</hi> otherwiſe called <hi>Anyme,</hi> whereof he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutes two varietyes, the one white, which alſo according to <hi>Briſſotus</hi> a Phyſician of <hi>Paris,</hi> is <hi>Dioſcorides</hi> his <hi>Cancamum;</hi> and the other ſomwhat black, which myrrhe or rather <hi>Mynea</hi> or <hi>Amy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nea.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Thus the obſcurity of the thing,
<note place="margin">Vires.</note> drives us to the affinity of names, there to inveſtigate the truth: but if I may ſpeak freely, I think that <hi>Anyme,</hi> or <hi>Amynea</hi> as ſome will have it, <hi>Myrrhe</hi> and <hi>Cancamum</hi> are three diſtinct things: and that, that which the ſhopmen call <hi>Lacca</hi> is that ſame which the ancients called <hi>Canca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> who being ignorant of ſome words depromed from the <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berians,</hi> believed ſuch things as they heard though never ſo ſlack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and ſo by calling <hi>Cancamum Lacca,</hi> left this liberty of diſcuſſing to the enſuing poſterity.</p>
                           <p>Some maintaine this opinion, ſaying that there are three ſorts of <hi>Lacca,</hi> one is <hi>Dioſcorides</hi> his <hi>Cancamum,</hi> which ſcarce any ever ſaw, the ſecond common <hi>Lacca,</hi> the third factitious, which Dyers uſe, whereof there are more differences, which for brevitys ſake I omit.</p>
                           <pb n="398" facs="tcp:37350:241"/>
                           <p>The vulgar Lacca is hard, pellucid, and yellow like Myrrhe, circularly involving the ſurcles of an exoticall Tree, which is not I think, elicited, elaborated, and cohibited to the boughs of that Tree by the ſucking and labour of <hi>Indian</hi> Ants, as <hi>Garcias</hi> affirmes; but exudes and concretes ſpontaneouſly, like other <hi>Gummes</hi> and Teares, for theſe animalls, labouring for victualls in Summer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Winter, do not expoſe their panifice, to the injuryes of the aire and Heavens, on boughs; but recond it in Caves and Holes, and few I hope will believe that <hi>Indian</hi> Ants will labour in vain for Lacca, and not congeſt and coact it for meat, but deſert it. That which is brought to us, circumveſts the ſticks of the Tree, is hard and pellucid, eaſily diſſolvable in water; and this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredes the trochiſckes of <hi>Carabe</hi> and <hi>Dialacca,</hi> and not the factiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Lacca</hi> as ſome perperouſly imagine.</p>
                           <p>It is not ſo much celebrated for medicinall as other mechani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call uſes,

                           </p>

                              <hi>Braſſavolus</hi> fooliſhly conſtitutes three ſorts of <hi>Dragons-Blood:</hi> the firſt factitious of pſeudobole; the ſecond the lacrymae of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Tree; the third <hi>Gumme.</hi> But as the adulterate is no ſpecies of <hi>Dragons-Blood;</hi> ſo neither can there be two ſorts, the one a <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cryma,</hi> the other a <hi>Gumme</hi> of the ſame Tree, for all <hi>Gumms</hi> lacrymouſly diſtilling from any Tree, are called generally lacrymae.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Aloyſius Cadamuſtus</hi> a noble Venetian, expreſſes its Originall better; There is (ſaith he) in an Iſland called <hi>Pontus Sanctus,</hi> which is one of the <hi>Canaryes, Dragons-Blood,</hi> which is the Lachry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma of a certaine Tree; which at a certaine ſeaſon the incoliſts fau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clate, out of which inciſions the next yeare <hi>Gumme</hi> will emanate, which they coct in kettles, and defaecate making thereof <hi>Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons-Blood.</hi>
                              <pb n="399" facs="tcp:37350:241"/>That Tree beares fruits like Cherryes in <hi>March,</hi> which are of an eximious ſapour, and Venetian colour.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Nic. Monardus</hi> ſeems to aſſent to this opinion, and aſſerts that <hi>Dragons-Blood</hi> is the lachryma of ſome Tree, and not the Goare of any animall; for (ſaith he) a few dayes agoe, a <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop brought hither, from the continent of the new World, ſome of the fruit of that Tree, which emitts that <hi>Lacryma</hi> we call <hi>Dragons-Blood.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The fruit is very admirable; for the skin wherewith it is cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed being taken away, a little <hi>Dragon</hi> appeares of ſuch artificiall yet naturall fabricature, that the moſt perite artiſt cannot better ingrave it in Marble; it is conſpicuous with an oblong neck, a gaping mouth, an aculeated back-bone, a long tayle and feet.</p>
                           <p>From this fruit both the Tree and its <hi>Lacryma</hi> derived their names: that is beſt which is brought from <hi>Carthage,</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The Tree is tall, with a thin barke, and eaſily vulnerable, whoſe name being unknown to the ancients, they wrote no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of the nature and originall of its <hi>Lacryma. Cluſius</hi> ſaw the Tree and deſcribed it accurately.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Dragons-Blood</hi> then, is the name both of an exoticall Tree, and the hard purpureous <hi>Gumme</hi> concreted on its boughs.</p>
                           <p>It is collective and agglutinatory, and therefore fitt to conjoyn wounds, and aſtringe and roborate laxe parts:

                           <p>Now <hi>Aſa foetida</hi> is the excrement,
<note place="margin">Aſa quid.</note> or <hi>Gumme</hi> of <hi>Laſer</hi> or <hi>Laſerpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium,</hi> which <hi>Dioſcorides</hi> calls <hi>Stilphion; Avicenna Altit,</hi> or <hi>Antit,</hi> the <hi>Indians Anjuden;</hi> and the Apothecaryes <hi>Aſſa,</hi> but more properly <hi>Aſa,</hi> as if they ſhould ſay <hi>Laſer,</hi> for <hi>Laſer</hi> is a <hi>Lacryma; Laſerpitium,</hi> a Plant out of which this <hi>Laſer</hi> or <hi>Aſa</hi> is elicited, not <hi>Aſſa;</hi> which according to <hi>Rhaſis</hi> is an hearb that ſome call <hi>Hyſſope,</hi> others <hi>Thyme:</hi> Now <hi>Laſerpitium</hi> is a ſerulaceous Plant with an annuall
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:37350:242"/>Caule, which they call <hi>Maſpetum;</hi> leafes like <hi>Apium,</hi> but flave broad and foliaceous ſeed; and a black, craſſe, long and cubitall root. <hi>Garcias</hi> indeed doth boldly pronounce <hi>Aſa</hi> a <hi>Lacryma</hi> of <hi>Laſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitium,</hi> but exhibites a jejune deſcription thereof, ſpeaking only a little of its leafes which he ſaith are like Haſſe leafes.

                           <p>I find each part of this Plant deſigned by a ſpeciall nomencla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; for ſome call its root <hi>Magudaris;</hi> its Caule <hi>Silphion;</hi> its leafes <hi>Moſpetum;</hi> its feed <hi>Folium:</hi> for (ſaith <hi>Theophraſtus</hi>) that folium is feed, but <hi>Magydaris</hi> differs from <hi>Laſerpitium;</hi> now whether it be a part of the ſame Plant, or another Plant allyed hereunto, it matters not; for <hi>Aſa</hi> is the <hi>Lacryma</hi> or <hi>Gumme</hi> of <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerpitium,</hi> which is either taken from its root or from its caule <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſtus</hi> calls that of the root, <hi>Radicarium;</hi> and the other, <hi>Scaparium.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>It growes in <hi>Armenia; Media, Lybia,</hi> and <hi>Syris;</hi> whence it is ſomtimes called the <hi>Lybian,</hi> ſomtimes the <hi>Median,</hi> and <hi>Syrian</hi> ſucce. They called it of old, the <hi>Cyrenian</hi> ſucce, becauſe it grew copiouſly and well in the <hi>Cyrenian</hi> feilds, but that name is now almoſt abrogated: for the <hi>Barbarians</hi> out of ſome hatred conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt the <hi>Cyrenians,</hi> eradicated and extirpated all their <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerpitium,</hi> as <hi>Strabo</hi> denotes.

                           <p>Hence the <hi>Germans</hi> call it the Devills dung: both of them are very odorate, but graveolent, ſo that I cannot eaſily aſſent to their opinion who think that one ſort of <hi>Aſa</hi> is ſweet; for neither the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour of the one nor of the other can be tolerated without loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomneſſe, whence I admite that <hi>Garcias</hi> ſhould ſay that no ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple medicament in all <hi>India</hi> ſhould be more in uſe then <hi>Aſa foeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi> both in medicines, and alſo in meats.

                           <p>All Roſine conſiſting of an oleous ſubſtance, and tenuious parts, is more promptly diſſoluble in oleous and affine liquors, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in diſſident from Gumme; which conſiſting of a more aqueous ſubſtance, is more expeditely and accurately ſoluble in aqueous liquors.</p>
                           <p>If we look to the conſiſtency of Roſines, we ſhall finde them of two ſorts; the one liquid, by the Greeks <gap reason="foreign">

                           <p>There is another kinde of Roſine, concreting without the help of fire, which the Greeks call <gap reason="foreign">

                           <p>Firre-tree Roſine is moderate in both qualities, which ſome do ill call Colophonian Roſine, for it remains long liquid: it ſiccates little, and flows but in ſmall quantity, and therefore more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious.</p>
                           <p>Turpentine is preferred before all other Roſines, Maſtick is next, then Firre-tree Roſine, then Pine-Roſine, and then Pitch.</p>
                           <p>Roſines are of much uſe, not onely in Pharmacy, but many other things; they mollifie, califie, digeſt, and are good ingredients in ſalves and unguents, for the curation of wounds and ulcers.</p>

                              <hi>Pix navalis,</hi> ſo called from pitching-ſhips, is that which is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raded from ſhips lately pitched, as <hi>Zopiſſa,</hi> of a longer continuance: when <hi>Pix navalis</hi> is put abſolutely, <hi>Zopiſſa</hi> ſhould be taken; and when <hi>Zopiſſa,</hi> this.</p>

                              <hi>Piſſaphaltum,</hi> is Pitch mixed with Bitumen, which the Ancients uſed in conditing dead bodies. Yet <hi>Dioſcorides</hi> thinks it is no arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial, but a natural commixture: for (ſaith he) <hi>that which we call</hi> Piſſaphaltum, <hi>grows in the Apollinatarian field, near</hi> Epidaurus. But we will treat more largely hereof, in the Chapter of <hi>Mummy.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Pitch differs from Roſine in this, that Pitch is educed by fire, and Roſine erupts ſpontaneouſly: They are both the product of
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:37350:246"/>the ſame Trees, but Pitch is as it were cocted Roſine.</p>
                           <p>The eduction of Pitch, is effected after the manner that we make Charcoal; for the middles of the Pine-trees are cut into ſpears, and congeſted upon an artificial Pavement; then the boughs of Firre and pitch-tree ſuperimpoſed; then all ſo covered with earth, clay, or ſuch incombuſtible matter, that no chink be left anywhere, ſave on the top, or other more convenient place, whereat they may immit the fire, and at firſt emit the flame: but when the <hi>Tedae</hi> are accended, they occlude all very ſtrictly and cloſely, leſt the flame ſhould erupt, and they be fruſtrated. If any chink dehiſce, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit any flame, or fume, they preſently obſtruct it: The Cluſters of of the Pine thus aeſtuating by the heat of the fire, emits Pitch co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piouſly into certain chanels artificially ſtructed, which carry it to troughs, and they to other veſſels, ſet on purpoſe to receive the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent. Now it acquires its Nigretude by the fume and heat, whence it is called Black Pitch: for, that which is flave, is rather Roſine then Pitch.</p>
                           <p>That which extills firſt, is more fluid and humid, which the ſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men call Liquid Pitch: <hi>Pliny</hi> calls it <hi>Cedria; Dioſcorides, Piſſelaeon;</hi> which is rightly ſo had, by ſeparating the aqueous humour, which ſaims upon the Pitch, as Cream upon Milk. Now it is beſt ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reted, while the Pitch is cocting, by ſuſpending a clean fleece of wooll in the fume of the Pitch, which will become madid there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with; and that we call <hi>Piſſelaeon</hi> may be expreſſed out of it: which is not properly a ſimple medicament, but rather a compound of Pitch and Oyl.</p>
                           <p>That which comes out ſecond, is more craſs and dry, and the laſt moſt craſs, and hardeſt, and moſt efficaciouſly exſiccative.</p>
                           <p>There is another kinde of ſuaveolent liquid Pitch, which Sepla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuries call <hi>Oleum Cadinum;</hi> ſometimes Tarre; which is moſt uſed upon Sheep and Cattel.</p>
                           <p>Seeing all Pitch is either liquid, or more ſicce; the ſincere, light, and ſplendent in both kindes, is moſt laudable; the liquid molli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, digeſts, abates dolour, cocts, moves ſnot, extricates the nails from ſcabroſity, emends Ring-worms,
<note place="margin">Vires.</note> diſcuſſes the hardneſs of the Matrix and Fundament: the dryer performs the ſame effects, but more imbecilly; but it ſiccates more potently, and is more accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated to agglutinate wounds and ulcers.</p>

That alſo which hath theſe qualities, and is ſomewhat flave, is good. That which comes from the Iſland <hi>Chios,</hi> and is
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:37350:247"/>thence called <hi>Chia,</hi> is moſt celebrated, for its antecellency in odour and guſt: The next is the <hi>Lybian</hi> Turpentine, as <hi>Andromachus</hi> himſelf atteſts; the next is the <hi>Pontian</hi> Turpentine: The leſs celebrous are the <hi>Cyprian, Syrian, Indian,</hi> and <hi>Arabick</hi> Turpentines.</p>
                           <p>The Turpentine-tree is concocted, fructious, and of a mean ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnitude, with a craſs caul, many and oblong boughs, long leaves, like them of an Aſh; many cohering to one pedicle, but craſſer and fatter, each of them ſeeming like a Laurel leaf: its flowers are very ſmall, moſſy, and purpureous; its fruits ſmall, racemouſly co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering, round, oblong, hard, fat, and roſmous, infecting the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trectants hand.</p>
                           <p>It bears alſo certain oblong Cods, incurvated like Cornicks; wherein certain little Vernicles, like Gnats, are included; and ſometimes a certain humour, as in the veſcicles of Elms: The mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of its wood is viſcid, and not hard; its roots are valid, and deep.</p>
                           <p>One ſort of the Turpentine-tree is maſculine, which is ſterile; another foe minine, which is ſoecund: and this, for the various co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of its fruit, is twofold; the one hears red fruit, of the magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Lentills; the other greater, pallid, and more fragrant.</p>
                           <p>It grows copiouſly in hot Regions, and germinates moſt floridly there, where its liquor mutuates cognominations, as in <hi>Chies, Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prus, Syria,</hi> about <hi>Ida,</hi> and <hi>Macedonia.</hi> Some there are that avouch, That hard, dry Turpentine, ſo concreted by the help of fire, is brought over and fold with us for Roſine. But I think, that none will coct Turpentine to loſe by it, unleſs he be out of his ſenſes: for Turpentine, be it how it will, is alwayes in more eſteem, and at a higher rate then Roſine, be it concreted with all the induſtry and helps that can be.</p>
                           <p>There flows a certain humid Roſine out of Larch-tree, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing like Turpentine, is often ſold to our Merchants in ſtead thereof: But Larigna is ſharp in odour, guſt, and faculties; and alſo of more tenuſious parts, and more diſcuſſive then Turpentine.</p>
                           <p>Turpentine is the Prince of Roſines, Maſtick is the next, and then the Roſine of Firre and Pitch-tree; after which, we enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merate Pine-Roſine: yet <hi>Galen</hi> prefers Maſtick before Turpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine.</p>
                           <p>Turpentine is the mildeſt of Roſines,
<note place="margin">Vires.</note> the moſt familiar Balſame for wounds; it califies moderately, mollifies, expurges, diſcuſſes, purges the reins, moves urine, and is an excellent praeſidy for many uſes. They know what eximious faculties it hath, who labour under a virulent flux of Sperm.</p>

                           <p>FRankincenſe is the rofinous lachryma of a certain arbuſcle in <hi>Arabia,</hi> which the Incoliſts call ſometimes <hi>Conder,</hi> ſometimes <hi>Lovan:</hi> whereof there are two forts; the one is Maſculine Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kincenſe, which is ſomewhat flave, limpid, pellucid, fat and dry; in purity emulating the Cedar-Roſine; in Nitre, it's ſucce: it may be it is called <hi>Olibanum Thw,</hi> becauſe it comes from the Mount of <hi>Lebanon,</hi> with the Greek article before it.</p>
                           <p>The other is the Foeminine Frankincenſe, which is more roſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous, ſoft, and liqueſtible, which yields in bonity to the former: They both flow out of a Plant, ſcarce known, ſave by ſome notes, becauſe it is peregrine, growing in <hi>Arabia,</hi> with leaves like the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick-tree: whereof there are two forts; the one montanous, which fruticating onely on rocky and rough Mountains, bears the beſt Frankincenſe; the other growing more copiouſly in plain places, emits Frankincenſe in much more abundance, but not ſo good: both of them are eaſily diſſoluble in Oyl.</p>
                           <p>The bark of the Frankincenſe-tree, is craſs, fat, odorate, light, ſmooth, and without membranes: it is indued with the ſame facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, but more hot, aſtrictive, and of craſſer parts then Frankin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe.</p>

                              <hi>Manna thur is,</hi> is that ſame duſt or powder which is elicited from Frankincenſe by Colliſion in carriage, or the like, as we have noted before. Frankincenſe is both introſumed,
<note place="margin">Vires.</note> and applied ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tranſecally with much ſucceſs; for it is indued with innumerable exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious faculties, which to recenſeate, would require too much of time and labour. It califies in the ſecond degree, ſiccates in the third, and moves Phlegm, but not very efficaciouſly.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Manna thuris</hi> is aſtrictive, becauſe of that portion of Frankin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe that is mixed with it; from which it differs, in that it is not ſo potently aſtrictive, nor coctive.</p>

                           <p>BElzoin is neither a ſpecies of the ſucce of Laſerpitium, nor of Cyraniacum, nor yet of Myrrhe, as ſome contend; nor yet the roſinous ſucce of Angelica, as <hi>Ruellius</hi> ſeems to intimate. For <hi>Laſer,</hi> or <hi>Aſa,</hi> comes from <hi>Syria, Cyrenene,</hi> and <hi>India,</hi> into other Regions; <hi>Belzo</hi> from <hi>Samatra, Sian,</hi> and other Regions, into <hi>India;</hi> which grows not on a ferulaceous plant, but a tall tree, whoſe caul is craſs, hard, brachiated with many boughs, very orderly diſpoſed, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terally extended; its leaves oblong and mucronated, like Lemmon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:37350:248"/>leaves, but not ſo green; for their averſe part is whitiſh; its wood is hard and odorate.</p>
                           <p>It grows ſpontaneouſly in many woods, both in <hi>Malaca</hi> and other Regions: whereunto, the frequency of Tygers hinders ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs.</p>
                           <p>Where theſe fierce animals are more rare, the trees are vulnera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Incoliſts, which effuſe copiouſly this odorate Roſine, which the Chineans call <hi>Cominhan,</hi> the Arabians <hi>Lovaniaoy;</hi> the Incoliſts of <hi>Guzarata</hi> and <hi>Decan, Udo.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>There are three ſorts of Belzoin:
<note place="margin">Species.</note> the one called Almond-Belzoin, becauſe it is maculated like condited Almonds, which is moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petible: the other two ſorts are very black; the one whereof is not very fragrant, and more vile; the other very fragrant, which exudes from new trees, and is by the Incoliſts of <hi>Samatra</hi> called, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nini de Boninas:</hi> the beſt, is that which is pellucid, referted with white ſpots, like Frankincenſe, and moſt fragrant.</p>
                           <p>Belzoin roborates the heart, ſpirits, and all its faculties: it is a good ingredient in ſweet Antidotes,

                           <p>But <hi>Dodoneus</hi> thinks it is not a tree, but rather an herb, with ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, craſs, and green leaves, rotundly angulous, armed with two ſets of white pricks; which leaves ſauciated, effund a moſt ſharp and mordacious liquor, which is eaſily concreted: for, as <hi>Galen</hi> writes, it is cauſtical and vulnerative, and ſo califies and extenuates, that therein it exuperates all concrete liquors.</p>
                           <p>It being thus acrimonious, and very tenuious, it cannot be pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verated without great moleſtation: wherefore Pharmacopoliſts commit it to ruſticks, and men of low degree, to bray; charging them to avert their heads from its halite: Yet they eſcape not its fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; for their brain and noſes are moved by its duſt and vapour, to ſternutation, heat, heat and dolour.

                           </head>
                           <p>THat fat liquor which ſhop-men call Gumme Elemni, is no Gumme, but a Roſine, which will eaſily take flame, and diſſolve in oleaginous liquors. <hi>Dioſcorides</hi> ſaith, it is like Scammony, but more flave; turgent with ſmall ſtillicides, no whit vellicating the tongue, nor mordacious to the guſt: whence, it is probable, he means of another lacryma, and not of this vulgar one, which the vulgar Pharmacopoliſts call Gumme-Elemi; it ſtills out of the Aethiopian Olive, and when it is concreted into lumps, is brought to us.</p>
                           <p>It califies, mollifies, digeſts, reſolves, cocts, draws to ſuppera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, allayes dolour, and is very good for permiſtion, with many unguents and ſalves.</p>
                           <p>Our Olives, and whilde-Olives, eructate ſuch a kinde of lacryma, but neither ſo copious, nor commendable, yet is a good liniment for hebetude and whiteneſs in the eyes: and if it be aſſumed, it mores fluors, and extracts the young; but I would not have it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troſumed, if it be poyſon, as <hi>Dioſcorides</hi> makes it.</p>
                           <p>There is a kinde of Roſine brought out of <hi>New-Spain,</hi> which the Indians vernacularly call <hi>Tacamahaca,</hi> like Gumme-Elemi,

                           <p>MAſtick is the beſt of gummeous Roſines; it exudes from the Lentisk: that which comes from <hi>Chios,</hi> and is odorate, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did, ſplendent, fryable, adulte, and ſcorched, is beſt; the green, and black, like Bitumen, are worſe. <hi>Theophraſtus</hi> ſaith, That the ſpine <hi>Ixina</hi> exuctates Maſtick; but that of the Lentisk is beſt for medicinal uſes (if there be any other.)</p>
                           <p>The Lentisk is a very rall tree, by the Greeks called <gap reason="foreign">

                              </gap>, from whoſe root branches erupt like Haſle ſprigs, brachiated with tough and flexible boughs: its leaves cohere by eight together upon one pedicle, which are like them of Liquoris, but harder: its flowers are moſſy, and many, adhering to long pedicles, whereunto berries of the magnitude of Vetches, ſucceed; which at firſt are green, by maturity black, of a fat ſubſtance, and turgent, with a black and hard Nut.</p>
                           <p>There grow upon Lentisks, beſides their flowers, leaves, and fruits, certain Utricles intorted like Cornicles, wherein a certain liquor is contained, which produces ſome inſects like Gnats, as in Elms, veſicles.</p>
                           <p>Its wood will make ſpecial tooth-picks, which will not onely purge, but roborate the teeth, conſtringe the gums, and conciliate ſweetneſs of breath: its eximious faculties make it a good ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute for Xylobalſame.</p>

                           <p>Maſtick is celebrated for many things, but eſpecially for allaying the dolours and affections of the ſtomack and ventricle; which does either by aſſumption or admotion: it takes away all loathſomneſs
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:37350:249"/>towards meat, roborates the retentive faculty, and helps coction: it cures ſuch as ſpit blood, or are infeſted with an inveterate Cough: it emands the breath, if commanducated, and gently tracts phlegm from the brain: it ſhould be ſprinkled with a little Roſe-water, that it may be pulverated; it will eaſily diſſolve in aqueous and oleagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous liquors.</p>

                           <p>CAmphyre is neither Bitumen, nor Medulla, nor compound Medicament, as ſome believe; but a certain pellucid gum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meous Roſine, unknown to <hi>Dioſcorides</hi> and the ancient Greeks, flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from a peregrine tree, which <hi>Garcias ab Horto</hi> ſaith, is like a Walnut-tree, but its leaves are more candicant: The matter of its wood is cinericious, or ſomewhat blacker; not light or fungous, but pretty denſe and ſolid.</p>
                           <p>This tree is tall, with boughs on every ſide, and of a fair aſpect, which eructates lacrymae; no whit more copiouſly when it thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and corruſcates, then when the heaven is ſerene, as many think.</p>
                           <p>This lacryma flows through the chinks of the tree, like other Gummes: it needs no coction to concilitate candor; for if duſt, filth, or the fragments of any ſtones or wood be mixed with it, that happens through the oſcitancy and errour of the collectors: the ſincere ſplendent and odorate is beſt.</p>
                           <p>Hereof there are two ſorts; the one, <hi>Camphyre de burneo,</hi> which is beſt, and is ſeldome or never brought to us; the other,
<note place="margin">Species.</note> Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyre of <hi>China:</hi> whence Pharmacopoliſts have it frequently: it is of much uſe in thoſe Regions where it grows, ſo that they ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times uſe it amongſt their meats.</p>
                           <p>Some aſſert, That it califies in the third degree; others affirm, That it is frigid: Many reaſons might be brought for both, which for brevity ſake I omit; and atteſt, That it is good both in hot and cold diſeaſes: for it is of a miſt quality, and ſeems by its odour and tenuity of its ſpirit to be calid, though its other qualities demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate its frigidity.</p>
                           <p>Many think, that Camphyre arceates the ſtimulations to venery, and hinders conception: Whereupon, <hi>Scaliger</hi> being not too credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, made tryal thereof, and found all to be falſe.

<note place="margin">Stacte, Quid?</note> are farre diſſident: For Stacte is the pinguetude of new Myrrhe, tunded and expreſſed with a little water, and reducted to the liquid form of an unguent; or rather, the fat creamy Gumme of Myrrhe, or the fat Oyl of Myrrhe tunded and expreſſed; or its ſucce educed by ſome tortive inſtrument.</p>
                           <p>The Stacte which is oleous, is beſt; it participates not onely of the calefactive quality, but many other faculties of Myrrhe.</p>
                           <p>As ſoon as Storax erupts out of the tree, it concretes into a hard, denſe, ſolid, and roſinous lump, with ſome white ſpots in it, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fragrant.

                           </head>
                           <p>MYrrhe, which the Greeks call <hi>Smyrna,</hi> is the concreted gum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meous ſucce of a certain tree, growing in many Regions in <hi>Arabia,</hi> as <hi>Sabe, Adramyta, Citibaena,</hi> and <hi>Mamali.</hi> This myrrhifluous tree is of a moderate magnitude, with a hard caul contorted towards the earth; ſmooth back like Purſlain, and aculeated leaves like an Elm. <hi>Dioſcorides</hi> makes it like the Aegyptian Spine; others like the Turpentine-tree: <hi>Diodorus</hi> aſſimilates it to the Lentisk; yet ſo, as it is more ſpinous and lower, for it is ſeldome above five Cubits light.</p>
                           <p>It grows moſt frequently in ſaboulous, dry, and incultivated pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but moſt floridly in cultivated ſoyls: They incide it from the root to its boughs, out of which wounds it emits Myrrhe; but it ſpontaneouſly diſtils a kinde of ſtillatitious dew before its back be opened, which they call <hi>Stacte,</hi> and many imperite Pharmacopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts, Liquid Storax; falſly aſſerting, That it diſtils from the ſame Tree. But we have before declared, that they flow from different trees, and that there is no liquid Storax, unleſs that we call Stacte, whic his no Storax.</p>
                           <p>But I return to Myrrhe, and the arbuſcle from which it flows, which is exotical and prergrine, rough, ſpinous, with ſharp and reuleated leaves, and in ſapour like Juniper: It delights and fruti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates copiouſly, in the ſame ſoyl and region with Frankincenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trees: its wound elacrymates a coagulated Gumme, of the ſame name with the tree. That which is fragile, ſmooth, concolorate in ſmall lumps, amare, acrimonious, odorate, and hath veins candid, and ſmooth like nails, is beſt.</p>
                           <p>That which is collected of the ſative tree, is better then that of the ſylveſtrian: but that is preferred before all, which bears the name of the place where it is had, and is called Troglodytical Myrrhe, which is ſomewhat green of colour, ſplendent, and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacious.</p>
                           <p>There is one ſort they call <hi>Pediaſimos,</hi> another <hi>Gaby;</hi> both which are good, and emit plenty of Stacte. There are two bad ſorts, one they call <hi>Caucalis,</hi> which is black and torched; the other <hi>Ergaſima,</hi> which is the worſt, it is macilent and hoary: there is alſo another called <hi>Mynaea,</hi> as ill as can be.</p>
                           <p>There is ſo much affinity betwixt Myrrhe and Bdellium, that many think they do not differ: but the contrary ſhall be proved by and by; both of them may be diſſolved in watery and oleous li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors, but neither accurately nor eaſily.</p>
                           <p>Myrrhe califies and ſiccates in the ſecond degree,
<note place="margin">Vires.</note> opens the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded Matrix, moves flowers, and accelerates the deliverance of young: Commanducated, it emends the graveolence of the mouth.</p>

                           <p>Stracte, which is much celebrated for its ſuavity and efficacy, may be ſubſtituted for <hi>Opobalſamum,</hi> but Stracte is more rare: it robo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates the ſtomack and principal parts, arceates putretude, recreates the ſpirit, and cures many diſeaſes from the Uterus and brain.</p>

                           <p>THere is a tree in <hi>Bactria,</hi> which is black, of the magnitude of an Olive, with leaves like an Oak, and fruit like a Fig-tree, not inſuave, whoſe lacryma ſome call <hi>Brochon,</hi> ſome <hi>Malathram,</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers <hi>Maldacon,</hi> and the Pharmacopoliſts <hi>Bdellium.</hi>

                           <p>The Indian, ſordid, black Bdellium, convolved into gobbets, is the worſt: ſome call it <hi>Adrobolon;</hi> that which grows in <hi>Media,</hi> called by Phyſicians, Parthian Bdellium.</p>
                           <p>Furthermore, out of what tree Bdellium exudes, is not concluded of amongſt grave and learned men; ſome ſay it flows from one like that which emits Myrrhe; other affirm the contrary: Neither can I at preſent determine this doubtful cauſe. Perhaps they both come from plants much alike, one from a ſative tree, the other from a wilde one; as we ſee many Apples, Pears, and Plums, much dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent in odour, colour and ſapour, which grow on trees very much agreeing. However, Bdellium is no whit rare, and we have it as good as ever the Ancients deſigned it.</p>
                           <p>It califies,
<note place="margin">Vires.</note> mollifies, reſolves, it diſcuſſes hardneſs, and gurtural tumours, and humid burſtings; it relaxates the ſpiracles of the Matrix, either by admotion or ſuffumigation; it extracts floors, young, and all humours.

For in ſome it is craſs, liquid, viſcid, glutinous, fryable, gum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meous: In others, fat, oleous, odorate, roſinous: In ſome, melleous, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteous, ſalſuginous, as we have declared before.

                           <p>All agree not about the qualities of Opium: for <hi>Dioſcorides,</hi> and many more, ſay, it is cold in the fourth degree;
<note place="margin">Its qualities.</note> 
                              <hi>Matthiolus</hi> oppoſes them, from its odour and acrimony. I think, it is of a miſt quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, participating of a light and fugacious calidity, but a more va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid and contumacious frigidity.</p>
                           <p>Beſides its elementary qualities, it hath others alſo, which much commend it, if exhibited opportunely, and in a juſt doſis, and much diſcommend it, if unduly uſed; for it doth not onely induce tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour and palſey, but leads to a perpetual ſleep.</p>
                           <p>Rightly prepared, and rightly adminiſtred, it helps much; for
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:37350:252"/>it cures perpetual watchings, by conciliating ſleep; it allayes and deceives the fierceneſs of any dolour, by making the ſenſe more ſtupid.</p>
                           <p>It is much uſed in <hi>Mauritania</hi> and <hi>Aſia,</hi> where they call it <hi>Amfium</hi> and <hi>Oſium,</hi> as though Opium were the moſt admirable exhilarator of the minde, and erecter of the body: whereunto they have ſo accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed themſelves, that if they ſhould totally abſtain from it, they would periclitate their lives.</p>
                           <p>The Turkiſh Souldiers uſed to eat it, that they might be more chearful for battel, and like drunken or mad-men, precipitate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves careleſly into danger.</p>
                           <p>Some think it ſtimulates to venery; but reaſon and experience re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fragate its uſe, rather arceating its heat, by making the motion of the fleſh more ignave.</p>

                           <p>Elaterium, according to <hi>Theophraſtus,</hi> is the inſpiſſated ſucce of a wilde Cucumer, which by a ſpecial propriety will keep two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years; it is (ſaith he) the moſt diuturnal of all Medicaments; and that is beſt which is oldeſt: which to experience, a certain Medick having received ſome for a gift, very old, kept it till its two hundred years were expired. The cauſe why it endures ſo long, I think is its copious humour, whereby it extinguiſhes a Candle, if it be ſet near it, till fifty years be perfected.

                           <p>Some reject this manner of accepting Ladanum, as fabulous, and yet ſubſtitute not an eaſier way. It is indeed ſo tenacious and viſcid, that it will eaſily follow contact, and may be excerped otherwiſe.</p>

                           <p>THe ſucce of Liquorice is expetible for many uſes; for it is exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miouſly bechical, being ſucceſsfully aſſumed ſolarly for the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of the lungs and breaſts, and frequently with no leſs benefit mixed with other Medicaments. <hi>Galen</hi> extols that which comes from <hi>Crete.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The Greeks call it <hi>Glycyrrhiza,</hi> the ſhop-men Liquorice, <hi>Celſus</hi> Sweet-root, the Batavians Sweet-wood; for its ſucce exhibits a ſweet and grateful ſapour, which is thus educed.</p>
                           <p>The roots of Liquorice collected in <hi>July,</hi> while new and humid,
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:37350:253"/>are purged and brayed, then cocted in water, percolated and expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; the ſucce expreſſed is ſiccated by evaporation by the fire,
<note place="margin">The way to juyce of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quorice.</note> or Sun, and kept: That is beſt, which is ſweeteſt, ſoft, new, pure, tenacious, blackeſt, and which is totally liqueſcible upon the tongue.</p>
                           <p>That which comes from <hi>Spain,</hi> is much commended; where it is made both copiouſly and well.</p>
                           <p>Liquorice is without of the colour of Box, within croceous: its wood is viſcid, and not eaſily frangible; its ſapour ſweet, quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thirſt; whence it is called, <hi>adipſas.</hi> That which is white or black within, exucce, old, fragile, and which makes duſt by its fracture, is not good. We have ſpoken hereof in the fourth Section of our firſt Book.</p>

                           <p>BEes are wonderful ſagacious, induſtrious, and ſedulous, in col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting and confecting Wax; which without their help, no part of the world can perform: for theſe little animals can ſolely act that which man cannot; theſe Infects ſolely do ſuppeditate both Aliments and Medicaments to man by their own opifice.</p>
                           <p>And yet the commodities of Wax are ſo many, and ſo great, that they cannot be eaſily recenſeated. The flave, odorate, mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately fat, pure, coacted Wax, which is void of all aliene matter, eadneareſt repreſenting Honey, is beſt. In the ſecond place, we take that which is candid, whether it be ſo naturally; as the <hi>Pontian</hi> Wax, or artificially by lotion, as the <hi>Tyrrhenian.</hi> Other colours are acquiſititious; as green by Verdegreaſe, red by Vermillion, black by Ink, or burned paper: From which mixture it changes its qualities. New ſubflave Virgin-wax is beſt.</p>
                           <p>It is in a mean betwixt heat and cold, humidity and ſiccity; yet it is ſomewhat craſs and emplaſtical: Wherefore it is the matter both of calefactive and refrigerative Medicaments. All Wax mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifies, califies, according to <hi>Dioſcorides;</hi>
                              <note place="margin">Cerae lotio &amp; dealbatio</note> and moderately expletes the body. It is good in broth for ſuch as have the bloody flux. That it may be dealbated, it muſt be melted at the fire, then demerged in pure Fountain-water, where it muſt be ſtirred and expurged. <hi>Dioſcorides</hi> deſcribes another way to make it moſt candid; which ſee in his ſecond Book, <hi>Chap.</hi> 105.</p>

                           <p>SUcces are kept either in a liquid conſiſtency, as Vinegar, Wine, and Omphacium; or in a ſolid one, as Aloes and Scammony; or elſe in a middle conſiſtency, as Rob and Sapa: of each whereof we have treated in order, partly in our Shop, partly in our firſt Book of Medicinal Matter.</p>
                           <p>And ſince I am ſo farre from approving of things ten times re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated, that the ſecond time offends me, I will not now return to the examination of what I have before delivered; for I could wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly wiſh this ſhort Work had been contracted into a leſſer bulk.</p>

                           <p>As for the ſucces of fruits, inſpiſſated to the conſiſtency of Rob and Honey, we have handled them in the fifth Section: and the firſt Section of the firſt Book, ſpeaks copiouſly of liquid ſucces.</p>
                           <p>Opopanax hath its name from <hi>Panax,</hi> whoſe ſucce, or rather gummeous liquor it is, which when concrete and dry, is ſubflave without, candid within, graveolent, ſmooth, fat, fryable, and eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly liqueſcible in water.</p>

                              <hi>THe matter of Medicaments is multifarious, not onely becauſe it ariſes from Plants, Minerals, and Animals, (of which we have treated before) but alſo deſumed from the Univerſal Tribe of Plants.

Therefore all Minerals are not onely of the Earth, as</hi> Ariſtotle <hi>hath deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, but ſome of the Sea; as Salt, Bitumen, and ſeveral kindes of Stones: of which we intend diſtinctly to Treat. But the method of our Inſtitutions doth require us, that we handle them briefly; therefore we ſhall haſten to the examination of them, and Rank them into a Treble File, by dividing this our Book into three Sections: In the firſt, we ſhall diſpute the Nature and Qualities of Earths; in the ſecond, of Stones; and in the third, of Metals.</hi>

                           </head>
                           <p>
                              <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He beſt of medicinal Earths, is that, which coming from the Iſle <hi>Lemnos,</hi> the ſhop-men call Lemnian Earth, and ſometimes Sigillated Earth, from that ſeal that is impreſſed upon it. There are many varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties hereof; the beſt of which uſed to be formed into Cakes, and ſigned by <hi>Diana's</hi> Prieſt with her Sigil, which repreſented a She-goat.</p>
                           <p>But the true ſigillated Earth, according to <hi>Dioſcorides</hi> and <hi>Galen,</hi> is flave or yellow, as the hill is whence it is digged; on which hill, neither Tree, nor Herb, nor Plant fruticates, nor a ſtone to be ſeen, onely this kinde of Earth in abundance.</p>
                           <p>Yet ſuch Cakes are brought to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> of a cineritious co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, noted with the Sigil of the Turkiſh Emperour, which is effigiated with no Animal, onely ſome various Characters; and theſe are bought and kept for true Lemnian Earth.</p>
                           <p>Neither the Incoliſts that make theſe Paſtils, nor the Inſtitors that buy them, mix Goats blood therewith, as many grave men exiſtimate.</p>
                           <p>This Earth is ſo far, that one that holds it in his mouth, and grindes it with his teeth, would think it conſiſted of greaſe.</p>
                           <p>It is Antidotive againſt the Peſtilence,
<note place="margin">Vires.</note> Contagions, and Diſeaſes that participate of malignant qualities: yet I believe, That the vain Ceremonies and Superſtitions of the barbarous Turkiſh Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, have more nobilitated this Earth, then any excellency in its faculties: and I do avouch, That if any one that would might effode it, it would loſe much of its celebrity.</p>
                           <p>The variety of the Characters wherewith it is noted, ariſes from the variety of thoſe Noble-men, who according to their cuſtome, are preſent on the ſixth of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> at its effoſion and ſigillation. Now all the Characters are contained in theſe two Arabick words, <hi>Tin Imachton,</hi> which denote Sigillated Earth.</p>

                           </head>
                           <p>THere is another kinde of Earth of eximious faculties, which comes out of <hi>Armenia,</hi> near <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> which the Medicks call Bole-arminack, or Oriental-Bole. It was, in <hi>Galens</hi> time, much uſed againſt that Peſtilence he ſpeaks of (<hi>Lib.</hi> 9. <hi>Simp. cap.</hi> 7.) It is in our pleaſure (ſaith he) whether we will call it a Stone, as he did that firſt gave it me, or an Earth, as I do, becauſe it may be rigated by humid things.</p>
                           <pb n="397" facs="tcp:37350:255"/>
                           <p>It comes not ſolely from <hi>Armenia,</hi> but many other Regions: that is the beſt, which will be moſt promptly laevigated, either by a Peſtel, or the affuſion of ſome water or liquor, containing in it no ſandy mixture, and which in manducation melts like butter, and is manifeſtly aſtrictive to the guſt.</p>
                           <p>It ſiccates, aſtringes, and roborates, ſtayes blood,
<note place="margin">Vires.</note> cohibits Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarrhs, profits the bloody flux, and Ulcers in the mouth.</p>
                           <p>It is very prevalent againſt the Peſtilence: Whoever (ſaith <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi>) aſſumed this Medicament, were preſently cured; but thoſe that this did not cure, dyed all; for no other remedy was more prevalent. Whence we may gather, That it cured all that were not incurable: and that I may ſpeak freely, Bole-Arminack is as efficacious as Lemnian Earth: And as we can eaſily be without the Turkiſh Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſtry and Hangings; ſo ſhall we not much ſtand in need of their Lemnian Earth.</p>

                           <head>CHAP. 3. <hi>Of ſome other Earths leſs uſual.</hi>
                           </head>
                           <p>THere are many other Earths commended by the Ancients, for refrigerating and occluding paſſages, and much uſed by them in Medicine, which the later Age doth ſo deſpiſe, that they are to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally excluded from Pharmacopolies, except ſome few, which for their candour, rubour, or other eximious colour, as flave, or the like, which are commended and bought by infectors, as Ocre, Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick, Synope, Ceruſs, and ſuch like.</p>
                           <p>Yet ſome of them are indued with eximious medicinal faculties, as the Melitean Earth; ſo called from the Iſle <hi>Melita,</hi>
                              <note place="margin">Melitea.</note> whence it comes; which is prevalent againſt the Peſtilence and Poyſons: Whence many uſurp it for Lemnian Earth.</p>
                           <p>The Samian Earth is a kinde of foſſile coming from <hi>Samos,</hi>
                              <note place="margin">Samia.</note> which <hi>Dioſcorides</hi> ſaith, is of two ſorts; the one he calls <hi>Collyrium,</hi> which, I think, may be mixed in Collyries for eyes; the other <hi>Samius aſter,</hi> becauſe there are certain ſpots in it, which ſhine like ſtars; it is cruſtaceous and denſe like a Wherſtone, being withall ſomewhat viſcous: This is burned and waſhed like white Earth, of whoſe faculties it participates, and thence cohibits the rejection of blood: the other, which he calls Collyrium, is ſoft, white, fryable, and adheres to the tongue: both of them refrigerate, and arceate fluxes.</p>
                           <p>The Chian Earth, ſo called from the Iſle <hi>Chios,</hi>
                              <note place="margin">Chia.</note> hath affinity with the Samian in face and faculties; for it is white, ſoft, refrige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative, and aſtrictive: it cures burnings, crugates the face, makes it ſplendid, and deleates ſcars.</p>
                           <p>There is another kinde of Earth called <hi>Selinuſia,</hi>
                              <note place="margin">Selinuſia.</note> which <hi>Galen</hi> commends againſt ſwellings beginning in the Paps, Teſticles, and ſmall Guts; which in colour, faculties, and conſiſtency, is finiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:37350:256"/>to the Chian: both are ſpecial Remedies againſt burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Dioſcorides</hi> makes mention of Fullers-earth,
<note place="margin">Cimolia.</note> whereof he conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes two ſorts; the one white, the other purpureous: that is beſt, which ſeems fat and cold to the tact; both of them diſſolved invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar, diſcuſſe-pimples and tubercles, repreſſe inflammations, and cure burnings.</p>
                           <p>The Eretrian Earth is,
<note place="margin">Eretria.</note> according to <hi>Galen,</hi> a red Glebe; the beſt whereof, is without ſand and ſtones. <hi>Dioſcorides</hi> makes two ſorts thereof; one white, and another cineritious; none red: that which is cineritious, is ſoft, and is the beſt. <hi>Eretria</hi> is a City in <hi>Euboia,</hi> near <hi>Calcis,</hi> in whoſe Territories this Earth is effoded, and thence nominated: it is aſtrictive, refrigerative, mollitive; it expletes ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vities, and conglutinates wounds.</p>
                           <p>Rubrick,
<note place="margin">Rubrica.</note> or Vermillion, ſo called, becauſe it is red, is called Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopica, from <hi>Synops</hi> a City of <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> whence it comes; and <hi>Fabrilis,</hi> becauſe workmen often uſe it in drawing Lines, their cords being died therewith. Some Rubrick is maculated, other unico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorate; ſome ſoft, other hard and ſpiſſe; ſome fat, other mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate. All of them are adapted to pictures; which, becauſe they ſiccate and aſtringe, ſerve ſometimes to medicinal uſes, and may be mixed in vulnerary and ſiccative Emplaſters.</p>
                           <p>Ocre is a kinde of flave Earth,
<note place="margin">Ochra.</note> much commended in <hi>Attica,</hi> not lapideous, but fryable, luteous, and ſmooth: it aſtringes, erodes, diſcuſſes collections, and repreſſes excreſcencies. <hi>Aetius</hi> ſaith, That bruiſes, and blue places, may be cured by a Medicament made thereof.</p>
                           <p>The Cretian Earth, or Chalk, is ſo called, from the Iſle <hi>Crete,</hi> whence it comes, though it is copiouſly found in other Regions; whereof there are many varieties; one ſort whereof is white, which exceeds all other Earths therein, which Artificers uſe in protract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Lines; another green, celebrated for the ſame uſe, which we ordinarily call <hi>Theodoſia;</hi> another is black, which workmen-Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and Taylors uſe: All of them are abſterſive; whence they are much uſed in cleanſing Tin and Silver veſſels. The green is more acrimonious then the white and black, and more abſterſive then both.</p>
                           <p>Other Earths, as <hi>Pnigitis, Melia,</hi> and <hi>Ampelitis,</hi> are recorded in <hi>Dioſcorides,</hi> and mentioned by <hi>Galen:</hi> But their vertue is ſo ignave, and effects ſo ſmall, that the later Phyſicians do not celebrate them; who leaving Acorns, chuſe rather to eat Whear. Theſe therefore being uſeleſs, I will not deſcribe.</p>
                           <p>There is a certain ſubrulous Earth carried about <hi>Lutetia,</hi> which they call <hi>Alana</hi> and <hi>Tripolis,</hi> ſerving onely to deterge brazen veſſels: which here we will omit.</p>

                           <p>THe Shop-men following the barbarous Mauritanian Idiome, call Chryſocolle, Boras: it is found in the golden, ſilver, and ſometimes brazen Mynes in <hi>Armenia, Macedonia,</hi> and <hi>Cyprus.</hi> The Armenian Boras, whoſe colour is green, and ſapour nitrous, with ſome amaritude, is moſt laudable. <hi>Pliny</hi> thinks, That that which is effoded out of brazen Mynes, whoſe ſubſtance is mud, concreted to the hardneſs of a Pumick-ſtone, is beſt; that which is collected out of Silver Mynes, next; and that which is had in Golden Mynes, worſt of the three. There is another ſort, which is worſt of all, found in Leaden Mynes. <hi>Avincenna</hi> calls Boras, <hi>Auri capiſtrum; Dioſcorides</hi> and <hi>Galen, Chryſocolle,</hi> or Gold-glue; others, Green Earth, becauſe it equalizes ſegetives in colour. That which is now in Phar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macopolies, is not green, but white.</p>
                           <p>There are two ſorts hereof: one Native, which in Metalline Mynes concretes to the hardneſs of a Pumick-ſtone, acquiring va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious colours, according to the variety of the Metals, out of whoſe Mynes it is effoded: the green is moſt medicinal, and the flave beſt for ferruminating gold.</p>

                           <p>THe Greeks call that Calchantum, which the Latines from its blackneſs call Sutory Ink, and from its ſplendent vitreous Nitre, Vitriol.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Dioſcorides</hi> reckons three ſorts thereof; two native, and one
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:37350:257"/>Factitious:
<note place="margin">Species.</note> one ſort of the Natives is found concreted in the bowels of the earth, another is collected in form of water, out of ſome Myne, which put into a veſſel, ſoon coagulates into Vitriol.</p>
                           <p>The Factitious is made of a certain glebe of earth, maculated with rubiginous and atruginous: ſpots, madefied, transfunded, and fermented with water, cocted with the heat of the Sun; out of which a certain vitriolous humour is elicited, which is reduced ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the heat of the Sun, or of a fire, into Vitriol. <hi>Pliny</hi> (<hi>Chap.</hi> 13. <hi>Book</hi> 34.) teaches many more wayes to confect it; as alſo many perite Metalliſts, which for brevities ſake I omit.</p>
                           <p>Amongſt the Factitious Vitriols, the Roman is the beſt; the Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian was moſt celebrated of old; the Germanian is worſe: and it is commonly called Copparoſe, or Dyers Ink, which Infectors uſe in dying clothes.</p>
                           <p>The Native, which is effoded out of the Cyprian Mountains, is called Stalacticum, that is, ſtillatitious; and pectum, that is, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete: ſo that the natural, which is either coagulated before effo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, or coagulates quickly after extraction from that Mountain; and the factitious, which is elicited out of the earth of that Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, may be both called Cyprian Vitriol.</p>
                           <p>The Native or Foſſile Vitriol, participates of Calcitis, Miſy, and Sory; eſpecially the Cyprian, which is concreted from green water, which continually delabes from that Mountain into a Cave, waſhing Calcitis, Miſy, and Sory, and ſpontaneouſly coagulating into Vitriol. Whence one of theſe doth eaſily tranſeate into an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other; for all of them do in time convene: yea, <hi>Galen</hi> aſſerts, That he ſaw Vitriol, which in tract of time became Calcitis. (<hi>Lib.</hi> 9. <hi>Simp.</hi>)</p>
                           <p>The Native and white, is preferred in Medicinal uſes, which the Metallicolous Alchymiſts ſay, is produced by their Sulphur and Mercury, as of Sperm, which they indiſcriminately exhibit to all affections: out of which they elicite a certain acid liquor; a few drops whereof, mixed with ſyrupe of Violets, acquire a moſt ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant red colour and ſapour. Oyl of Sulphur will do the ſame; and a few drops of both, or one of them, infuſed in the ſyrupe of Roſes, will make the whole liquor red,
<note place="margin">Tinctura Roſarum.</note> which they call Tincture of Roſes.</p>
                           <p>There is a certain ſalve made, which Pharmacopoliſts call Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calciteos, from Calcitis, and Diapalma; or Palmeous ſalve, from Palme; and it is alike related to both: for it neither admits of Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citis, nor Palme, in its confection; but ſo it is called for its rarity: for Calcitis, Miſy, Sory, Melanteria, Diphryges, and many more, ſo much celebrated by the Ancients, are now unſeen and unknown. Whence <hi>Galen</hi> ſubſtitutes Vitriol in ſtead of Calcitis, into whoſe nature age perduces it. And it may well be ſubſtituted in ſtead of Miſy, Sory, and Melanteria, for all theſe are of near affinity, being ſimilar in qualities, but diſſimilar in colour and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtency.</p>
                           <pb n="401" facs="tcp:37350:257"/>
                           <p>Nature hath enriched Vitriol with eximious faculties, which pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite Phyſicians have both experienced, and left deſcribed; as <hi>Dioſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corides, Galen, Aelius, Paulus, Aegineta,</hi> and <hi>Oribaſius,</hi> who have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitated it with much celebration: it califies, aſtringes, dries, kills broad worms in the belly, helps againſt toad-poyſon, preſerves moiſt fleſh, and contracts humours by abſumption, exarceates putretude, roborates the intimous parts; externally applied, it aſtringes, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges Ulcers, cauſes wrinkles like Alome, with whom it hath rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The Wells of <hi>Spada</hi> being indued with a Vitrioline quality, do miraculouſly cure grievous and deplorable affections. Which excellent faculty, they borrow from Vitriol, by whoſe energy they pervade all the tracts and corners of all parts, everting what is hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, not hurting what is good; binding what is more lax, relaxing what is bound; and inciding, melting, attenuating, and expelling what is more craſs. But beſides theſe excellent commodities, Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol hath its incommodities alſo: for, it is ill for the ſtomack, acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious, eroſive, and vomitory; and therefore many Monks and women give it ſometimes in Wine, and ſometimes in Roſe-water, in uncertain weight, againſt quotidian and quartane Agues: and indeed the Feaver is often, by the excitation of vehement vomiting, reſolved. But this Medicament being imperitely exhibited, proves often more formidable then the diſeaſe.</p>

                           <p>ALome (ſaith <hi>Pliny</hi>) is as it were the brine of the earth, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <hi>Dioſcorides</hi> makes three ſorts; the round, the liquid, and the jagged or ſciſſile: the laſt is often called plumeous Alome; for they are ſo like in form, that they can ſcarce be diſtinguiſhed; yet they differ both in nature and qualities: for the ſciſſile is manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſtrictive, and may be burned; but the plumeous is acrimonious,
<note place="margin">Sciſsile plumeum.</note> and ſuffers not by fire. It ſeems to be the ſtone Amiantus, which, wood-like, conſiſts of many incurſant Lines, and is not burned by fire, which many take for that Amentus that ingredes the Citrian unguent.</p>
                           <p>There is another ſort, very vulgar and uſual, lucid, ſpiſſe, and hard, like glaſſe, which Phyſicians call Rock-Alome,
<note place="margin">Alumen rupeum.</note> which ſhould alwayes be uſurped, when Alome is deſigned abſolutely. The manner of confecting this, is long and laborious, which <hi>Matthio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> deſcribes accurately. There is black Alome in <hi>Cyprus,</hi> that <hi>Pliny</hi> makes mention of.</p>
                           <p>Some ſay, that round Alome is the ſame with that they call Zu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charinum, which is confected of crude Rock-Alome, white of Eggs, and Roſe-water. <hi>Matthiolus</hi> ſaw, handled, and taſted li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid Alome: of which he atteſts, that he never found any thing more aſtrictive.</p>
                           <pb n="402" facs="tcp:37350:258"/>
                           <p>Beſides theſe, there are ſome factitious Alomes, as Catinum, which is made of the aſhes of Kali, and vulgar Soda; as ſquamous Alome, which is made of a ſpecular ſtone, pellucid like glaſſe; as Lees-Alome, which is made of Wine-Lees burned and albified. I think it ſuperfluous to deſcribe the manner of confecting theſe A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomes, ſince they are now of no uſe.</p>
                           <p>All Alome is of craſſe parts,
<note place="margin">Vires.</note> bindes much: whence it is called Stypterion, becauſe it is ſtyptical or aſtrictive: it califies mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately, cleanſes, emends putrid Ulcers, dries humid ones, abſumes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creſcent fleſh, takes away itching, cures the ſcab, and accedes uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to many Medicaments made for Ulcers.</p>

                           <p>AS nothing is more common, nothing more frequent; ſo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more known then Salt: without which, Beaſts can, but we cannot ſubſiſt. Whereof there are many ſorts; as Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalt, Foſſile-ſalt, Lake-ſalt, and River-ſalt.</p>
                           <p>Sea-ſalt is moſt common, and beſt, which is ſolely uſed in <hi>France.</hi> Foſſile-ſalt, which ſhop-men call Gemme-ſalt, is broken and effoded out of Mynes like ſtones; it is ſplendent like Chryſtal: This caſt into the fire, doth not crack like the reſt, but ignifies like Iron.</p>
                           <p>There is alſo Indian-ſalt, which <hi>Meſue</hi> uſes in the confection of Pills of Azure-ſtone: but this being wanting, we ſubſtitute gem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meous Salt. They miſtake, that think, that <hi>Meſue</hi> means by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian-ſalt, that Sugar which he calls Tabarzet; we, White: for the Indians have their Salt, which they effode from the Mount <hi>Oromenus,</hi> in great lumps; in whoſe ſtead, our gemmeous Salt will ſerve well, as in acuating the ſlower faculty of Agarick and Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pody.</p>
                           <p>Ammoniack, or Armeniack-ſalt, being very ingrateful both in ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour and colour, and gifted with no eximious faculties, is judged incommodious: it concretes into broad plates under the Cyranium ſands, with black veins extrinſecally; in colour it comes near Alome we call Schiſton, as alſo the Salt we call Alkali and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinum.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Dioſcorides</hi> commends Lake-ſalt, and Phrygian-ſalt; but we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre our own.</p>
                           <p>The flower of Salt, which flows upon <hi>Nilus,</hi> is neither ſeen of nor deſired by us: it is as it were the Spawn of a certain River; as alſo the broth of Salt, and the flower of the ſpamous Sea in <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſcorides.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>There is another kinde of Salt, they call Nitre, denoted with a double difference; the firſt is the light Nitre, of <hi>Dioſcorides</hi> and the Ancients: its colour is roſeous or white; it gapes with ſome holes
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:37350:258"/>like a ſpunge, it ceaſes now to be brought to us: the other is more vulgar, called Salnitre, or Saltpeter, which ingredes the confection of that powder, which is made of many nitrous waters in <hi>France</hi> for warlike Inſtruments.</p>
                           <p>While it is laboured with much coction, it eructates Aphroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trum, or ſpume of Nitre, different from that which the Ancients mention, which is thought to be native, not artificial; as alſo a certain friable lanuginous matter, white and ſaltiſh, which adheres to many walls, which is thought to be the flower of Nitre. I ſhall not now ſpeak of the confection of Nitre, becauſe it appertains not to Apothecaries.</p>
                           <p>The faculties of Salt are great, many, and very uſeful to man, but not ſo neceſſary in Pharmacy, as many think, who praedicate many wonderful and vain things, of Salt educed by Chymical Art; for they mordaciouſly aſſert, that there is a purgative faculty in Medicaments becauſe of Salt: and when they have got ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract from any Medicament, they averre they have got its Salt. However, Salt is very conſervative; it aſtringes, abſterges, purges, diſcuſſes, repreſſes, extenuates, and vindicates from putretude; yet ſome Salt is better then other.</p>
                           <p>Seeing Brine is its liquor, it exhibits the ſame effects:
<note place="margin">Vires.</note> it is mixed with Glyſters, to excite the expulſive faculty, which is flow in ſuch as are infeſted with the Lethargy and Apoplexy.</p>

As long as Bitumen ſwims on the water, it is ſoft; but when it is off, it becomes ſpiſſe and harder then, and reſembles dry Pitch, yet eaſily liqueſcible at the fire.</p>
                           <p>Many Lakes are bituminous, but eſpecially one in <hi>Judaea,</hi>
                              <note place="margin">Sodomeus Lacus.</note> thence called <hi>Aſphalites,</hi> and The dead Sea, becauſe of its vaſtity, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe its water remains almoſt immovable, not ſtormy, but heavy, falt, craſs, and foetid; wherein neither Plants nor Animals breed; neither doth it nouriſh ſuch as are injected, or admit them into its bowels.</p>
                           <p>Some enumerate a kinde of Foſſile terrene matter,
<note place="margin">Carbo petrae</note> which ſome call, but falſly, The Earth Ampelitis; others better, Stone-coal, which ſeems to be a kinde of Jet, of which they make Beads and Images, which ſtrangers wear in their Hats, amongſt ſolid Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuments.</p>
                           <p>All Bitumen is not ſolid and hard, but ſome there is, perpetually liquid and fluid, called <hi>Naphta,</hi> which is the colature of Babylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian Bitumen, white of colour, and moſt capacious of fire: for
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:37350:259"/>there is ſo much cognation betwixt this and fire, that it will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently leap into it, when near it. There is alſo black Bitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</p>
                           <p>As the true and native Bitumen of <hi>Judaea</hi> and <hi>Sodome</hi> come not to us, in whoſe ſtead we uſe Piſſaphaltus, or factitious Bitumen, made of Petreol, Pitch, and other things: ſo neither the true Naphta, in whoſe ſtead we aſſume a certain liquor, that falls from the fields near <hi>Modena,</hi> which they call Petreol, as if it were Oyl educed out of a Rock; for both have the ſame canſiſtency, colour, and vertue: But Piſſaphaltus is the commixion of Pitch and Bitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, as its name deſigns, which ſome uſe for Mumy: of which hereafter.</p>
                           <p>All Bitumen diſcuſſes, mollifies, glutinates, defends from inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, by obfaction, ſuffumigation, or impoſition; emends the Proptoſis and ſtrangulation of the Uterus: but our Bitumen is ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome right.</p>
                           <p>Naphta extenuates, incides, digeſts, penetrates, abſumes frigid and craſſe humours in all parts of the body, and cures the reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Nerves, Palſey, and diſeaſes in the arteries from a cold cauſe.</p>

                           <p>SUlphur is either native and foſſile, called Brimſtone and Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulphur; or factitious: the native is naturally generated of a certain fat portion of earth; much whereof is in <hi>Lipara, Melos,</hi> and ſuch places, where the factitious is made: the ſplendent, pel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucid, and not ſaxous, is beſt; whoſe colour without is ſubcincritious, within ſubluteous.</p>
                           <p>Many Mountains are very ſulphureous, as <hi>Aetna,</hi> which eructates perpetual flames.</p>
                           <p>The factitious is made of ſome fat Glebes, which are effoded out of ſulphureous Mynes. The manner of its confection, I leave to ſuch Ruſticks as are exerciſed therein: the green and fat is beſt.</p>
                           <p>Sulphur hath much cognation with fire; for if it be caſt upon coals, it will burn, and not be extinguiſhed, till all its oleous and fat ſubſtance be abſumed.</p>
                           <p>All Sulphur is not alike in colour; for ſome is green, ſome more luteous, ſome cineritious, and ſome pallid or lucid. Whence we may gather, That it is of more ſorts then two. <hi>Pliny</hi> alſo enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates four, ſome whereof are harder, others fatter, and others more inflammal.</p>

                           <p>That Sulphur whereof Alchymiſts tell many vain and ridiculous ſtories, is not common Sulphur, yet it is mixed, though they aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert, that it is a principle of mixture. But no more of that in this place.</p>
                           <p>There is a certain fat liquor, very efficacious,

                           <p>ORange-coloured Amber is variouſly denominated: the Greeks call it Electrum; the Perſians and Mauritanians, Charabe, that is, catch-ſtraw; the Germans, Gleſum, that is Glaſſe, becauſe it is ſplendent; the Romans, Succinum, becauſe it is the product of ſucce, or Sea-bitumen concreted; but not the ſucce of Pine or black Poplar, as many have aſſerted: for it is found in the deeps, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Sea-ſhores, concreted of the fat juyce of the Sea and Earth.</p>
                           <p>This matter, whileſt lent, viſcid, and fat, before it be obdurated and dryed, catches and detains many Flies, Gnats, Ants, and ſuch like Inſects; which dye, dry and odorate, together with the Amber.</p>
                           <p>This Amber is either white or flave: the white, which is more odorate and lighter, is good: ſo alſo is the flave, if pellucid, and ſuch as may be made by attrition, to ſmell like Roſemary, and attract chaff or ſtraw.</p>
                           <p>Its Powder given in convenient liquor, cohibits the flux of blood, roborates the bowels, and is good againſt the white fluor of the womb: one dragm thereof taken in a ſoft Egge, will ſtay the flux of Sperm, and will help ſuch as are tabid, infeſted with hardneſs of inteſtines, difficulty of breathing, and long Coughs.</p>

                           <p>COral is from its effigies, hardneſs, and native ſoyl, frequently, and not improperly called <hi>Lithodendron,</hi> as if it were a Stone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree, and ſometimes a Sea-ſhrub: for <hi>Macer</hi> ſaith, it ſeems to be the bough of ſome arbuſcle, for it grows in the Tyrrhenian and Sicilian Seas; aſſurging and emitting branches like a little Tree.

                           <p>It is threefold; one ſort is red, another white, and another black: the firſt, as it is of a more jucund aſpect, ſo more medicinal, and more apt for Bracelets, and other Ornaments. The white, as it is more ſpongious, ſo more light and refrigerative: the black is moſt rarely ſeen, leſſe medicinal and expetible; red is the beſt, which is alwayes underſtood, when Coral is preſcribed abſolutely. There is another ſort of Coral of a mixed colour, which is not ſo good: the red that is beſt, ſhould be of a florid colour, odorate, like Alga, ramous, like a ſhrub, very frangible, not rough, nor hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, or chanelled.</p>
                           <p>All Coral refrigerates, dryes, and bindes:
<note place="margin">Vires.</note> it cohibits the immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate flux of fluors and blood, it cures the Dyſentery, repreſſes the flux of mans ſperm, and the white fluors of a womans Uterus.

                           <p>AUripigment, Arrhenick, or Arſenick, Sandaracha, and Riſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galum, differ not, ſave in name onely: All are effoded out of the ſame pit; all are ſeptical and acrimonious, with extreme calour; diſſolving, deſtroying, and preying upon the principles of life.

                           <p>Auripigment and Sandarax, are of the ſame Metals, and ſeem onely to differ in more or leſs coction; and therefore they are both often mixed in the ſame glebe. There are two ſorts of Auripig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; one of a golden colour, <gap reason="foreign">

                           <p>Sandaracha hath not onely affinity with Arſenick from its native ſoyl, but nature alſo; for it is onely Arſenick well cocted, for that by uſtion will become Sandaracha, as Ceruſe will Sandyx, which they call Painters-red. <hi>Pliny</hi> makes mention of another ſort of Sandaracha, which he refers to ceraginous honey.</p>

                           <p>Few things are ſpoken, and that but by few, concerning Riſaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum; inſomuch, that we can ſcarce from their dignments know what it is. <hi>Bern: Deſſennius</hi> calls it factitious, white, and cryſtal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line Arſenick. But perhaps the ancients did more wiſely in its diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition, not to detect ſuch mortal lethal poyſon. <hi>Sylvius</hi> ſaith, it is found in the ſame pits with Arſenick, which ſome call Auripig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                           <p>All Arſenick is eroſive,

                           <p>For the ſpirit of Arſenick, which conſiſts in ſalt, as the Alchy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts ſpeak, is very bad, and cannot either by its fixation, or extraction, be ſo deleated, as to be ſecurely introſumed into the body.</p>

                              <hi>DIoſcorides</hi> his <hi>Cinnabaris,</hi> which is the ſucce of a certain tree growing in <hi>Africa,</hi> which is uſurped for Dragons-blood, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers much from the Cinnabaris, ſo called by later writers, which is a Mineral, whereof there are two ſorts, the one native, the other artificial: The native is alſo twofold, the one whereof is effoded out of certain ſilver Mynes, as thoſe in <hi>Hydria,</hi> which ſeems to be a purpureous glebe, referted with Quickſilver, out of which it fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently iſſues ſpontaneouſly; the other is found in the Veins of ſilver Mynes; and is the <hi>Minium ſecundum:</hi> of which here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
                           <p>There is alſo an artificial Cinnabaris, made of Sulphur and Quickſilver coacted by the fire; which <hi>Braſavolus</hi> calls Cynapri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, to diſtinguiſh it from the native Cinnabaris, which, with <hi>Dioſcorides,</hi> he holds to be the lacryma of an Aphrican-tree.</p>
                           <p>But indeed Cinnabaris, Cynaprium, and Vermillion, or Red-Lead, are all one, eſpecially with the later writers, who adducing them all to the teſt of reaſon, found them not to differ; and thoſe that pertinaciouſly contend for their difference, exhibiting an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curate deſcription of each, do at laſt conclude them one: for the variety of names do often ſo obſcure the thing, that he may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed who thinks Cinnabaris, Cynaprium, Milton, and Vermilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to diſcrepate.</p>
                           <p>Cinnabaris then is of four ſorts; the firſt is <hi>Dioſcorides</hi> his Cin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabaris, which is the ſucce of an Aphrican-tree, called Dragon; the ſecond is a Mineral, ſhining with much rubour, and not very pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous,
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:37350:262"/>which is found in ſilver Mynes; the third is factitious, of fulphur and quickſilver, ponderous, and intermixed with red and argenteous lines; the fourth is found in ſilver Mynes, and kept in ſhops in form of a powder very nitently red, which ſome call Cinnabaris, ſome Milton, ſome Minium; the ſhop-men Vermilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſome Sandix.</p>
                           <p>Now Sandix is burnt Ceruſs, which for its eximious redneſs, <hi>Serapio</hi> calls Vermillion: from which opinion the later writers diſſent not.</p>
                           <p>But that purpureous powder which Apothecaries keep for Vermil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, is by <hi>Fliny</hi> called the ſecond Minium, which is found in ſilver Mynes, acquiring that fair rubetude by artificial and reiterated waſhing; ſo that according to <hi>Pliny,</hi> one Minium is differenced from another, onely by waſhing and art: yet the firſt Minium or Mineral Cinnabaris, which emits much quickſilver by the fire, needs no ſuch waſhing; the ſecond or vulgar, which is called Red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lead, is red in the fire, but eructates little or no quickſilver, and is ſeldom uſed in Medicine.</p>
                           <p>Cinnabaris being referted with much Mercury, participates of the ſame ſaculties: which being notorious to the very Barbers, and pore-blinde, is often by Circulators uſurped to the cure of the French diſeaſe, who make ſuch fooliſh attempts thereof, as they bring many into the Palſey, more to death.</p>

                           <p>MErcury or Quickſilver, is the prime idol of the Alchymiſts, which they pronounce the principle of things, and ſperm of Metals; and indeed ſo true each, that nothing is more falſe: for if Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals have any ſperm, it is within themſelves, not elſewhere to be ſought; nor will ever mixed bodies naturally reſolve themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Salt, Sulphur and Mercury; though theſe Chymical Vulcans do Hammer them out, as <hi>Dom. Riolanus</hi> hath learnedly proved againſt them. This Mercury or quickſilver, is as it were the Monſter of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which will not be ſubdued under Natures Laws: it is whiter then any ſilver, more fluxile then water; more permeable then Vinegar; yet it never madefies, often refrigerates, often califies; ſometimes curing onely frigid affections, ſometimes onely calid ones: when it ſeems frigid, then it induces calid effects; when ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid, frigid ones: it ſometimes hurts in ſmall quantity, alwayes in great: it eaſily loſes its proper form, and eaſily reſumes it; and in this it is Miraculous, that it often profits being introſumed by the mouth; and often cauſes Palſey, trembling, and other prave effects, when extrinſecally applied. (<hi>Falop. Cap.</hi> 27, <hi>&amp;</hi> 76. <hi>Lib. de lue Vener.</hi>)</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Trajan</hi> ſaw ſome, who being anointed with a liniment made of
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:37350:263"/>Quickſilver before their deaths, in the junctures of whoſe armes he ſound much Quickſilver, when he diſſected their dead bodies.</p>
                           <p>He ſaw another, who being onely thrice anointed with Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilver, vomited many humours, wherewith much Quickſilver was confounded.</p>
                           <p>It is alſo ſtoryed of one <hi>Antonius Gallus,</hi> that he being oft beſmear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Medicaments of quickſilver, and not voiding any by ſpittle, that much was mixed with his urine, wherewith gold might be ſo dealbated, that they would take it for ſilver.</p>
                           <p>Yet <hi>Braſavolus</hi> would have it aſſumed at the mouth, to kill Maw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wormes; and <hi>Fracaſtorius</hi> avers, that certain women aſſumed each of them a pound of quickſilver to kill their young, which yet recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved no harm, they being fruſtrated in their deſign, and the young excluded duely and alive.</p>
                           <p>Yet the ſame Author having afterwards approved, and diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of its uſe, confeſſes ingenuouſly, that he is ignorant of its qualities; but boldly aſſerts, that it will cure the French diſeaſe.</p>
                           <p>One <hi>Jacobus Carpenſis</hi> was the firſt that preſcribed quickſilver to the cure of this diſeaſe, whoſe uſe was ſo ſucceſsful, that he preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly became very rich thereby: the Neotericks following him, mix it both with internal and external remedies; for its uſe is deprehended both wayes, as being indued with an alexiterial faculty, whereby it extinguiſhes the venereous poyſon in the French diſeaſe: for it is its antidote; though it be no way ſafe, unleſs it be well handled, duely caſtigated, and opportunely given: for we have known many, who taking quickſilver from the unskilful, have either periſhed, or fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len into a worſe caſe then before: for this is a beaſt which can ſcarce be tamed by any art; and therefore <hi>Galen</hi> is excuſable, who feared to uſe it, and durſt not make trial of its faculty, having learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from <hi>Dioſcorides,</hi> that it was deletory. Such as work Lead or other Metals wherein there is any portion of quickſilver, are apt to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract trembling, Palſey, and corrugation of Nerves. Thoſe alſo that effode quickſilver out of Mynes, though ruſtical and robuſt Men, yet do they ſcarce tolerate that labour for four years, but die miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly; for it is an untamed Medicament, whoſe active vertue and effect are both ancipitous; and though it be liquid, yet very pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous Metals will ſwim upon it, as wood upon water; except Gold, which ſinks therein.</p>
                           <p>Now quickſilver is either natural or artificial: the natural diſtils drop by drop out of the glebes of many Mynes, as of thoſe in the Mount <hi>Hydria;</hi> or, fountain-like, flows copiouſly out of ſome vein in a Myne, ſmitten with a ſpade, or other Iron Inſtrument.</p>
                           <p>The artifical is made, or rather extracted, out of Cinnabaris; of which we have ſpoken in the former Chapter: I cannot aſſent to <hi>Braſſavolus,</hi> who, after <hi>Vitruvius,</hi> aſſerts, that Mercury may be made of Marble; unleſs that I could ſay with the Alchymiſts, that this Sulphur and Salt may be elicited out of all mixed bodies.</p>
                           <p>Its qualities are as yet under debate; for ſome from its effects
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:37350:263"/>ſay, it is hot, others cold: <hi>Avicenna,</hi>
                              <note place="margin">Vires.</note> whom <hi>Palmarius</hi> and many others follow, ſays it is cold and moiſt; <hi>Fracaſtorus, Tomitanus,</hi> and others, who attribute an eroſive faculty to it, contend for its calidity: I, with <hi>Trajanus,</hi> think it of a mixed quality, participating of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other faculties, but conſiſting chiefly of ſubtile, and calefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive, craſſer, and refrigerative parts: for it incides, attenuates, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrates, melts, reſolves, ſubduces the ventricle; and, what is moſt to be admired, partly by an attractive faculty, attracts humours from the ſuperficies to the centre, that is, to the ventricle, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes them by ſtool; and partly by an impulſive faculty, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels them from the centre to the habit, and ejects them by ſaliva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                           <p>It is uſed for both ends in the French diſeaſe: and it often works the fluor of the belly, when it is given for ſalivation; often ſaliva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when it is intended for the fluor of the belly.</p>
                           <p>It is ſometimes redacted to white and ponderous powder, of which we have treated elſewhere; which, without moleſtation, ſubduces the belly, but harmes the bowels, wherein it leaves the malign impreſs both of it ſelf and <hi>aqua fortis,</hi> in which it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merged, as I have obſerved in many, who committed themſelves to ſome Circulators.</p>

                           <p>AFter the Adamant, which is onely famous for its hardneſſe, being of no uſe in Pharmacy, the Emerald takes place, whoſe elegant viridity, eximious dignity, and efficacious vertue, prefer it before all Precious-ſtones; then which, nothing can be objected more pleaſant, nothing more grateful to the Eyes: for the lenity of its colour refreſhes fatigated Eyes, which the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour of others offend. The <hi>Arabians</hi> call it <hi>Zamarrut.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Emeralds are found in many places, but the beſt amongſt the Giants, called Cyclops, or Ariſmaſpi, becauſe they have onely one round eye in the middle of their foreheads: for <hi>Ariſma</hi> with them denotes one, and <hi>Spu,</hi> an Eye.</p>
                           <p>This people hath continual warre with Gryffons, that they may more freely effode Gold and Precious-ſtones, wherewith their Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains abound, which many Gryffons, fierce and cruel Birds, inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, which dilacerate men; and like vigilant keepers, puniſhing the tomerity of great avarice, ſet upon each one they ſee, with their adunc Beaks and Claws.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Pliny</hi> makes twelve ſorts of Emeralds: whereof the Scythian, which are lucidly green, are the beſt; then the Bactrian, which are ſometimes found in the junctures of Rocks; next, the Aegyptian, which are got out of Hills and Rocks near a Theban Town called
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:37350:264"/>
                              <hi>Copton;</hi> the reſt are found in Braſſe Mynes: of which ſee <hi>Pliny,</hi> (<hi>Cap.</hi> 6. <hi>Lib.</hi> 37.)</p>
                           <p>Our Merchants ſell onely three ſorts, diſtinguiſhed by reaſon of the minority or majority of their value; for they ſet a ſmall eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate upon braſſe Emeralds, obſcure variegated, not tranſlucid, and all ſuch as have either Jaſper or Beryl, or other ſtones mixed with them.</p>
                           <p>The beſt Emerald is of one colour, ſplendid, pellucid, liquidly green, and pleaſant to the eye.</p>
                           <p>The Emerald-ſtone is of ſuch eximious faculties, that it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved preſervative from the falling-ſickneſs, included in a Ring: it alſo roborates the Memory, loves Chaſtity, and is ſo averſe to the ſopperies of Venery, that when the King of <hi>Hungary</hi> went in to his wife, the Emerald in the Ring wherewith her finger was adorned, broke into three parts. And ſeeing its faculties are ſo eximious, <hi>Meſue's</hi> Interpreter did well, though beſides his Authors meaning, to put an Emerald in the Electuary <hi>de Gemmis,</hi> in ſtead of <hi>Feruzegi,</hi> or rather <hi>Peruzegi,</hi> that is, <hi>Turcheſa,</hi> or <hi>Eranus,</hi> which is of no vertue not uſe in Medicine, but Emerald of much; whoſe commendable colour and excellent faculties, <hi>Marbodaeus</hi> thus loftily warbles forth:

                           <p>SAphyre is a Gemme of no very precious value, eſpecially the wateriſh, ſo named from its colour: but the ſplendent, which is of an azure-colour, is of high eſteem; of which the Poet thus comments:

                           <p>The watery, or as the Lapidaries term it, the white Saphyre, doth ſo much emulate the Adamant, that it hath deceived many: Both ſorts are found in <hi>Calecut,</hi> but the better are brought from <hi>Zeilan</hi> and <hi>Pegu.</hi>

<q>
                                 <l>Ardentes gemmas ſuperat carbunculus omnes.</l>
                                 <l>Nam velut ignitus radios jacet undique carbo.</l>

                              </q>
                           </p>
                           <p>It hath the name of Carbuncle then from fire; whence the Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians call them not onely <hi>Anthraces,</hi> but <hi>Pyropi;</hi> or, as ſome will have it, <hi>Apyroti,</hi> becauſe they are not altered by the fire, nor yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come warm.</p>
                           <p>They are of ſo many different ſorts, that they can ſcarcely be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned by peculiar names, or diſtinguiſhed: thoſe that come from <hi>Carthage</hi> are moſt excellent, elegant, fulgent, and precious: the Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiopian are next; the Alabandian next; thoſe that come from the Syrtes and India, next; thoſe that are like other ſtones, are the worſt and leaſt elegant, for they are impure, and almoſt like Marble, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure, flave, or whitiſh. Some think, that the Carchedonian Rubines borrow their dignity from <hi>Carthage,</hi> not from their pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chritude.</p>
                           <p>Merchants ſell onely five ſorts of Carbuncles: one ſort whereof is very red and ſplendent, called Carbuncle abſolutely, which is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry rare, and fit for Princes; the other not ſo fulgent, which they call true Rubine, which is frequent enough.</p>
                           <p>The third degree of dignity, they attribute to that which they corruptly call Bullaeſium; the next to Rubith, which they call Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel; the laſt to Granates: of which in the ſequel Chapter.</p>
                           <p>Many hold, that Carbuncles are of both ſexes, to wit, Male, and thoſe they ſay are ſuch as ſhine more ſplendently; and Female, which ſhine more groſly and fatly.</p>

                           <p>A Granate is ſo called, becauſe it is like the ſtone of a Pome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>granate; and it is a kinde of red Rubine, leſs elaborate by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and imperfected: it is indeed red, but obſcure, as if it were a Rubine covered with a ſmall cloud: whence ſome call it the blac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh Rubine.</p>

                           <p>Sarda is not pellucid, but ruddy in colour, reſembling fleſh: whence it is called Carneol, not Corneal, as ſome ſay; for it is not white like a horn.</p>
                           <p>The Sardonix participates of both their colours; for it is like a mans nail impoſed upon the fleſh, and withall tranſlucid.</p>

                           <p>Whoſe attractive faculty was at firſt found out by a certain Herdſman, who following his Cattel on the Mountain <hi>Ida,</hi> at length came to a place where there lay plenty of Load-ſtones; whoſe ſhoes being ſtuck with Iron nails, and the one end of his ſtaff plated with the ſame Metal, were ſo faſt retained by this hamous ſtone, that he muſt either leave his Iron, or tire himſelf with pulling.</p>
                           <pb n="418" facs="tcp:37350:267"/>
                           <p>Now this Paſture was called <hi>Magnes,</hi> whoſe name this ſtone re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains to this day: it is alſo called the Heraclean-ſtone; not from <hi>Heraclius</hi> its inventor, as <hi>Taiſnierius</hi> will have it, but from <hi>Heraclia</hi> a City in <hi>Lydia,</hi> where much good Magnetical ſtone is got. Some call it Syderites, becauſe it draws and allures Iron: it is alſo ſometimes called Ship-ſtone, becauſe it ſerves to much uſe in Ships.</p>
                           <p>There are five ſorts hereof: the firſt is called the Aethiopian Magnet, which comes from <hi>Aethiopia;</hi> the ſecond the Magneſian, that comes from <hi>Magneſia;</hi> the third is found in <hi>Alexandria;</hi> the fourth in <hi>Echion</hi> of <hi>Boeetia;</hi> the fifth, which is worſt, in <hi>Capo Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lichi Natoliae.</hi> This is light and ſpongious, like a Pumick-ſtone. The Aethiopian Magnets are judged beſt: all, of what ſort ſoever, are ſo much better, by how much more caeruleous; ſuch alſo as are more ponderous, and attract Iron more firmly, are very laud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
                           <p>An Adamant hinders the attractive vertue, as alſo Garlick rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed on the Magnet; for its attractive faculty is not ſo valid, but it may be eaſily deluded, obſcured, and ſuperated: and therefore <hi>Taiſnierius</hi> his aſſertion is very ridiculous, to wit, That certain ſhips compacted with Iron Nails, ſailing along the Aethiopian Sea, and driven by a tempeſt to the Promontories, ſhould be by Magnets drawn to the bottom, or ſhivered to pieces, their Nails being by their potency extracted; for theſe are old-wives Fables, not worthy the Pen of an Author.</p>
                           <p>The Magnet draws Iron as its ſimilar, for its own conſervation and alimony; for which purpoſe, they put its duſt in bexes; and it reſpects the North as its Matrix: whence Mariners ſay, it tends to the Antarctick Pole.</p>
                           <p>There is another ſtone called Theamedes, of an oppoſite quality, got in a certain Mountain in <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> which repels and reſpuates Iron.</p>
                           <p>Some ſell burnt Magnet for Hematites; but they are much differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, as appears by their deſcription. <hi>Dioſcor.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The Magnet beſides its enumerated faculties,
<note place="margin">Vires.</note> hath alſo ſome Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicinal qualities, for whoſe cauſe it ingredes the divine ſalve, and others Medicaments: ſome thinke that a ſmall quantity of a Magnet aſſumed at the mouth, will preſerve youth; and therefore King <hi>Zeilan</hi> commanded that all the diſhes and veſſels wherein his Meat was to be cocted, to be made of Magnets.</p>

                           <p>THere are yet almoſt infinite Gemmes, both fair and elegant to ſee to, and indued with ſpecial faculties; whoſe uſe being very rare, I purpoſe not to treat of every of them in ſeveral Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pters: for, it ſatisfies mine Inſtitution, if I accurately deſcribe theſe that ingrede the confections we have delivered in our Shop; yet leſt ſome Apothecaries ſhould think there were no more Gems, in this one Chapter I ſhall comprehend and Epitomize a great many.</p>
                           <p>The firſt that occurs is Eranus, which the French call Turcheſa,
<note place="margin">Turcheſa.</note> the Arabians Peruzaa; <hi>Pliny,</hi> Callais, and Augites; whoſe co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour ſeems to be confuſedly, but elegantly mixed of an azure and green: it is had in <hi>India,</hi> eſpecially about the Mountain <hi>Cokas.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The Jaſper ſtone is either totally or in a great part green and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant; whoſe ſpecies to enumerate, would tyre a man;
<note place="margin">Jaſpis.</note> for <hi>Macer</hi> ſaith, they are ſeventeen: it is very efficacious in ſtaying blood.</p>
                           <p>The Blood-ſtone took its Greek name <hi>Haematites,</hi> from blood alſo;
<note place="margin">Haematites.</note> for whether it be carried or aſſumed, it cohibits the iſſue of blood: it is thought to be a kinde of Jaſper; for it is green, variegated, and as it were beſpotted with drops of blood.</p>
                           <p>Achates, is ſo called from the River <hi>Achate,</hi> where it is found:
<note place="margin">Achates.</note> there are many varieties thereof, but the moſt vulgar are obſcurely white, diſterminated with veins either red or black. It is ſtoried of King <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> that he had a ſpecial one, wherein Nature had ingraven the Nine Muſes. Some Achates are red like Coral.</p>
                           <p>The Amethyſt is a ſtone brought from <hi>India,</hi>
                              <note place="margin">Amethyſtus.</note> of a purpureous mixed with a violaceous colour, emitting ſome ſmall flames; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of there are five ſorts, the more vulgar is violaceous, reſembling the colour of red Wine, much diluted with water: it is ſaid to hinder ebriety, but to excite dreams.</p>
                           <p>As the whitely corruſcant Adamant, the green Emerald, the flainmeous and red Carbuncle, the caeruleous Saphyre, and the golden Chryſolite, are the beſt of thoſe kindes: ſo is the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riegated Opalus,
<note place="margin">Opalus.</note> in whoſe mixture is the micant fire of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buncle, the purpureous fulgour of the Amethyſt, the caeruleous viridity of the Emerald, and all nitent colours moſt elegantly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentned; then which, no aſpect is more beautiful. <hi>Pliny</hi> calls this ſtone Paederos: it is got in the Iſland <hi>Zeilan,</hi> and in many parts of <hi>India,</hi> where it is called Argenon: it is alſo found in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> where it is called Senites.</p>
                           <p>There is another kinde of Opalus, leſs elegant and nitent, which they call Pſeudopalus, and Cats-eye; which, as it is not ſo fair, ſo
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:37350:268"/>not ſo expetible as the true Opalus. This is in probability the ſtone that <hi>Iſidore</hi> calls Ophthalmius.</p>
                           <p>There is another ſtone appertaining to the kinde of Opalus,
<note place="margin">Panthera.</note> which from its variegated colour, reſembling the Panther, is called Panther; and it is thought to be indued with as many vertues as colours.</p>
                           <p>The Selenite,
<note place="margin">Selenites.</note> ſo called from the Moon, which it repreſents, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap>is a ſtone of a ſhining, candid, and yellow colour, which increaſes and decreaſes as the Moon doth: ſome of this kinde are greener, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers paler.</p>
                           <p>The Giraſol,
<note place="margin">Giraſola.</note> which ſome call the Sun's ſtone, others Loucopeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>los, is repoſed among thoſe Gemmes which are candidly nitent, and emit an aureous fulgor.</p>
                           <p>There is a noble Gemme called Dionyſia;
<note place="margin">Dionyſia.</note> which brayed and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, though it reſemble the ſapour of Wine, yet it reſiſts ebrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. The Poet thus deſcribes it:
<q>Nigramicat rubris Dionyſia conſita guttis.</q>
                           </p>
                           <p>Beryl is a Gemme comprehending many under it of the ſame name;
<note place="margin">Beryllus.</note> ſome whereof are caeruleous, others paler, others flave, and aureouſly fulgent, which are often called Chryſopraſi; others in colour reſemble oyl, and others other things, ſo as its ſpecies are nine: Beryl ſhines obſcurely, unleſs it be brought to a Sexangular form.</p>
                           <p>There hath been of late a ſtone mixed with a green and lacteous colour,
<note place="margin">Nephriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus lapis.</note> brought from <hi>New-Spain,</hi> which they call the Reins-ſtone; which bound to ones arm, doth by a ſpecial propriety break and propel the ſtone.</p>
                           <p>Aetites is as it were a pregnant ſtone,
<note place="margin">Aetites.</note> ſounding when ſhaken, which derives its name from Eagles, by whom, as it is ſtoried, it is got, and poſited in their Neſts, to allay the heat of their Eggs, leſt they califie too much during incubation; others think otherwiſe, and ſpeak much falſly concerning it. However, it is a ſtone that will accelerate birth, if applied to the things; but retard it, if bound above the ſtomack, or carried betwixt the Paps: there are four ſortsof it, which may be learned from <hi>Pliny.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The Jewiſh ſtone,
<note place="margin">Lapis Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daicus.</note> which is named from its native ſoyl, is white, of an elegant form, of the magnitude of an Acorn, diſterminated with lines ſo equally diſtant, as if they had been artificially fabri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated: Brayed, levigated, and aſſumed, it breaks the ſtones in the Reins and Bladder.</p>
                           <p>The Chryſolampe is pale on the day,
<note place="margin">Chryſolapis.</note> but on the night ſplendent as fire; it is had in <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> but ſeldom brought to us.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Pliny,</hi> and ſuch as write of ſtones, recenfeate innumerably more: but they write of ſuch as they never either knew or ſaw; and they uſurp many ſtones, conjoyned by ſome affinity, for one and the ſame; and often conſtitute the ſame ſtone denoted by many names,
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:37350:268"/>as multifarious: for <hi>Pliny</hi> avers, That the names of ſtones are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt innumerable.</p>
                           <p>There reſt yet many ſtones of eximious vertue and high eſtimate; but becauſe they are deſumed from Animals, as Unions, or Marga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites, the Bezaar-ſtone, and the like, we ſhall treat of them in our Book of Medicaments, deſumed from Animals or their parts.</p>

                           <p>MArble is a moſt notorious &amp; hard kind of ſtone; of which there are as many differences, as places whence they are elicited: the nobleſt are theſe; the Pheugitical, Parian, Zeblical, Porphyritical, and Ophytical Marble; all are approved or diſapproved from their colour, nitre, perſpicuity, and durity. That which is green or va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riegated, and hard withal, is faireſt and beſt; that alſo which is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry candid and ſolid, is commendable; and ſuch muſt be ſelected to the confection of the Citrian unguent.</p>
                           <p>The Pheugitical Marble ſhines moſt, and repreſents Images. <hi>Nero</hi> bunt a Temple of this ſtone, to <hi>Fortune;</hi> which ſhined ſo with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, that though the doors and windows were ſhut, yet was it clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perceptible.</p>
                           <p>The Parian is not all alike, for ſome is very white, which is very very frequent in <hi>Italy,</hi> others cincritious; ſome green, others ferre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: which laſt ſort is ſo hard, that ſome make Anvils of it.</p>
                           <p>The Zeblical is found in <hi>Miſena:</hi> This is the ſofteſt, and is thought goed againſt Poyſon; which, if ſo, is the beſt of Marbles.</p>
                           <p>The Porphyritical Marble is moſt-what variegated with red ſpots; it is brought out of <hi>Aegypt:</hi> that which is beſet with white ſpots, is called Leucaſticon, whereof they make good and excellent Peſtels and Modules.</p>
                           <p>The Ophytical or Serpentine-Marble, is partly green, partly va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riegated with many other colours, like a Serpents skin; whence it hath its name: the moſt ſpots in the vulgar are pale, with others very diſſimilar.</p>
                           <p>Some Marbles are alſo nobilitated from ſome Men, and ſome Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions; as <hi>Luculus</hi> his Black Marble; <hi>Auguſtus Tiberius</hi> his Marble; alſo Aegyptian, Theban, Epheſian, and Lacedemonian Marble.</p>

                           <p>Now this Gypſum is a white and nitent ſtone, eaſily diviſible in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to plates, and fit for Structures, Edifices, and Walls. Crude Gypſum is not uſurped to the fabrick of houſes, but it is firſt burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, till it become tabid, white, and eaſily pulverable; then diluted with water, which afterwards concretes to a ſtony hardneſs: before it be hardened, it is agitated with a Spade, ſubacted, and wrought ſo as it may be ſoft and ſequacious, more fit to agglutinate ſtones, or compact other works. It is beſt when newly cocted; for if it be long kept, it will be more humid, and will not concrete ſo ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidly.</p>
                           <p>There are two ſorts hereof: the one more common, which is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurely nitent; the other more rare, which is cloven into plates, and ſplendent, like ſpecular ſtone: whence many call it Talkum, but improperly; for Talkum is more ſlender, ſquamous, white, and lucid: Some call it Selenite; ſome juglers by their deceptive art,
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:37350:269"/>make an oyl of Talkum, to waſh, erugate, and dealbate old Wives faces withall; and ſo daily deceive ſilly women, that will not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure deformity, with their vain promiſes, whileſt warily, yet not illicitely, they put their hands into the womens Purſes (for it is no injury or deceit to beguile thoſe that conſent and are willing.)</p>

                           <p>CHalk, Lime, and Gypſum, are agglutinative ſtones, uſed in compacting rich mens houſes; for poor mens cottages are emented onely with a little clay ſubacted. Now Lime, after it hath once drank water, bears it not again; but Chalk is nouriſhed by water, and longer and better preſerved therewith. When I name Chalk, I mean, that which is very white, pulverable, friable, and by infuſion in water inflammeable.</p>
                           <p>For crude Chalk is a hard ponderous ſtone, that will neither diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve, nor wax white in water, and is more properly called Chalk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone.</p>
                           <p>In what parts Chalk is found, there is no Lime; and where Lime is found, there is no Chalk: that Chalk is beſt, which touched with water, makes a noiſe, ignifies, and is cineritious; for age makes it whiter, but more infirm; for the air is got into it, and its fire is abared.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Dioſcorides</hi> ſayes, That Chalk may be made of the ſhells of Cockles, Muſsles, or Oyſters, ſo long burnt, till they be perfectly white.</p>
                           <p>An eximious Pſylother may be made of quick Chalk and Auri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pigment, which will eaſily depilate rough places: This alſo, with ſomeother things, will make good Pyroticks, which will burn the part they are applied to.</p>
                           <p>Chalk often waſhed with pluvial or fountain-water, may uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully be mixed to ſuch unguents as cure cadaverous Ulcers. Chalk extinguiſhed with water, and twice or thrice waſhed, if it be again caſt into water, makes that water very convenient for the Ulcers in the Privities, and other running cadaverous and dangerous ſores in other parts: for, by much waſhing, it depoſes its mordacity, and ceaſes to be ſharp; but yet it callfies and ſiccates manifeſtly, and ceaſes to be ſharp; but yet it califies and ſiccates manifeſtly, and is therefore good to exſiccate Ulcers, and induce ſcars.</p>

                           <p>SPunges by nature accede nearer to Plants then Animals; for they have accreſcion and augmentation, but no fenſation, as many

                           <p>Gold, the King of Metals, is of that kinde moſt perfect and compact; which bearing the tincture of the Sun in its coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, exerciſes ſolar Dominion over all Mortals: for all obey Gold,
<q>Aurum lex ſequitur &amp; auro venalia rura. <hi>Diphil.</hi>
                              </q> For nothing is more potent then pure Gold; to him men give ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, for him men undergo great labour: and whoſo wants it, may either like a Leper ſejoyn himſelf from conſort; or like a dead carcaſe walk amongſt men.</p>
                           <p>But ſeeing it is adiaphorous, and either good or bad, according to the intent of the uſer; if it be ill uſed, it is the worſt of evils, for it is the ring-leading Captain of Contention, the plague of life, and the ruine of the Commonweal: Hence Raptures, hence Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaughters, and hence Battels enſue: but if it be well uſed, it is thought to be not onely the Subſidy of life, but the guarder of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, if introſumed. But I do not mean Chymical potable, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther eſculent Gold, which refects the recipient onely with a lye, and vain expectations: for, grant we that the Alchymiſts can by their deluſive Art extract a flave liquor, emulous of melted Gold; yet this is ſo far from curing Leproſie, inveterate Dropſies, and other deplorable diſeaſes; or from retarding old age, and conſerving youth florid and vegetive, as they boaſt, that it is plainly of no noted uſe in Medicine; ſeeing the nature of Gold is ſo diſſident from our nature, that it cannot be to us reſtorative, as <hi>Scaliger</hi> well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves (<hi>Exercit.</hi> 272.) and there being many things more agreeable to our nature, they muſt needs be more conſervative of it: and what is more abſurd, then to ſay, that Gold nouriſhes, repairs our ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and yet changes not into our nature? for thus he that eats Gold, will be a golden Fool like <hi>Midas.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Medicks therefore do not labour to diſſolve Gold, for that is all one, as if they ſhould deſtroy its native bonity, and induce an alien quality, either uſeleſs or noxious; but they do better, by working it into thin leaf, duſt, or atomes, that it may more eaſily inſinuate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the parts of the body.</p>
                           <p>Gold thus prepared, doth uſefully ingrede <hi>Electuarium de Gemmis, Galens</hi> laetificative powder, and roborative Medicaments. I was wont ſucceſsfully to preſcribe to rich Wenches of ill colours, the filings of Gold, in ſtead of prepared Steel, with other fit Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſometimes in form of Pills, ſometimes of Tabels.</p>
                           <p>The Medicinal faculties of Gold are indeed many;
<note place="margin">Vires.</note> yet neither ſo great nor ſo many, as Alchymiſts predicate: it is chiefly commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

                           <p>SIlver alſo is as very Soul and Blood to Mortals; for after Gold, it is the moſt noble of Metals, which age neither corrupts nor hurts, but alwayes remains nitid, ſplendid, and ſincere, eaſily duci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and liqueſcible: it is made in the bowels of the earth, of clean and candid Quickſilver, and pure, clear, firm, and white Sulphur, equally contempered, and ſo it evades candid and fulgent. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, the heat of well-claenſed Sulphur, dealbates and makes it more ſubtile, and ſo exſiccates it, that it becomes tinalous, hard, and ſonore.</p>
                           <p>This alone of Metals ſeems to emit a tranſlucid ſplendor; for its light in the Myne, doth in a manner repreſent the rudiments of ſtars in a dark place: But when it is more pure, and purged ſeven times in the fire, as the Pſalmiſt ſings, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 11. then it is farre more ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. The Alchymiſts compare it to the Moon, whoſe name they give it, but its qualities are not anſwerable.</p>
                           <p>It is judged colder then Gold,
<note place="margin">Vires.</note> whoſe vertues and dignity it in ſome degree participates of, being next to it in perfection and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.

The Alchymiſts extract an oylout of it, which they commend to many diſeaſes in the Brain: but dogmatical and true Medicks, onely uſe its powder or leaves in Medicaments, and they that do otherwiſe, work deceitfully.</p>

                           <p>TInne is another kinde of Metal, found in the Myne with Silver, which <hi>Pliny</hi> calls White-Lead, to diſtinguiſh it from Black-Lead, which is as it were the purgation of Silver and Tinne left in the Furnace. Such as devote Tinne holy to <hi>Jupiter,</hi> ſay, it is generated of pure and clear Quickſilver, and craſs and immund Sulphur.</p>
                           <p>There are many things common betwixt Lead and Tinne; for neither of them contract ruſt, but rather ſome ſqualour or filth, whereunto Lead is more addicted then Tinne; neither of them are ſonore, nor very hard, onely Tinne is a little more ſonore and hard then Lead.</p>
                           <p>Tinne is either ſimple, pure, and defaecated; or impure, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded

The firſt liquor which flows in furnaces, is called White-Lead, or Tinne, the ſecond Silver, and that which remains, the Latines call <hi>Plumbago,</hi> out of which Lead is elicited.</p>
                           <p>It is extracted alſo out of a certain Plumbary, effoded out of Mynes, which ſtone they call Molybdoides; and the Lead thus ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned and melted, is poured into water, while hot, till it leave its droſs.</p>
                           <p>Morters and Peſtels for Medicinal uſes, are made of Lead; as alſo round Pipes or Canes, for deep and internal Ulcers, which are as good as golden Pipes.</p>

And hence we have theſe occurrents, <hi>Aerarium Publicum, aes alienum, &amp; queſtor erarius.</hi> Their bellatory arms alſo were not of ſteel, but braſs, as alſo their Statues and Temple-doors.</p>

                           <p>But the vulgar is copious, and every-where venale, which may be made many wayes, but moſt uſually thus:</p>

                           <p>This way is alſo moſt uſual: one or more plates of braſs are ſo ſuſpended in a Hoſhead, containing Vinegar, that they may not touch the Vinegar, and the due dayes being expired, the Verdegreaſe is deraded.

                           </head>
                           <p>NOthing is more common, nothing more uſeful, and nothing more nocent, then Iron: for, neither houſes, ſtables nor ſhips, nor yet ſuch things as reſpect mans veſture and aliment, can be had or made without Iron; ſeeing no labour is ſuſcepted, no work abſolved, without the adjument hereof: for all Artificers need ſome Iron Inſtrument to their work. All which I will not in ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial proſecute, ſeeing it is notorious to every Ruſtick.</p>
                           <p>For, not onely Plough-ſhares, Saws, Hatches, Sickles, Tongs, and Needles; but alſo Swords, Spears, Darts, Arrows, and Canon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bullets, which beat down whole Cities and Fortreſſes, killing men, and perpetrating a thouſand ſlaughters, are made of Iron: which <hi>Pliny</hi> not induring, cries out, we do not only uſe Iron at hand, but ſend it to do our miſchief at diſtance; one while ejecting it out of Slings, another-while of Croſs-bowes, and ſometimes making it fly with feathers; as though death were not ſwift enough, but we muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celerate his feet with wings, and arm him with Iron.</p>
                           <p>What if <hi>Pliny</hi> had ſeen our Canons and bellical torments, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with we do not onely overthrow Cities and Walls, but Rocks and Mounts!</p>
                           <pb n="431" facs="tcp:37350:273"/>
                           <p>But Iron is not the cauſe of theſe miſchiefs, but the wicked guiles of mans ingeny, which puts that to ill uſe, which in it ſelf is good: for it makes alſo wayes and paſſages, whereby putrid blood is edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced out of the veins; corruption ejected out of the breaſt; frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of bones, and other things that would moleſt the brain, drawn out of the ſeull; corrupt teeth evelled from the gums; the cadaverous fleſh of Ulcers removed; a putrid member abſcinded, left it ſhould draw the reſt into its conſort. What needs more? We cannot live without Iron; for elſe we might effode Dens with our Nails, in ſtead of Houſes, and car our Meat like Beaſts.</p>
                           <p>There are two ſorts of Iron: one retains its name, the other being more defaecated, is called Steel. There are two differences of the former; the one may be melted and drawn, of which they make many ruſtical inſtruments; the other may be melted, but not drawn, being very fragil, whereof they make molten Pots, and other culinary inſtruments: After which uſe, <hi>Scaliger</hi> thinks it is not uſeleſs, but may be molten again; as alſo, that ſame which he elſwhere ſays onely mollifies: for we ſee, that both ſorts may be melted by ardent heat; yea, ſome at <hi>Lutetia</hi> ſeek and buy the frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Iron Pots, which they carry to the furnaces, and melt over again.</p>
                           <p>Some ſay, that Steel is nothing but Iron accurately defaecated; and many boaſt, That they can work Iron into Steel: It hath its Latine name from <hi>Chalybo,</hi> a Town in <hi>Aſſyria;</hi> yet that of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſcus</hi> is moſt laudable, for a Sword of that Steel will cut Iron.</p>
                           <p>There is a Powder made of Steel-duſt, which Alchymiſts call <hi>Mars</hi> his Saffron: but Iron-duſt duly prepared, is every whit as good. We have treated of both in our Shop.</p>
                           <p>And as Braſs hath its aerugo or Verdegreaſe, ſo hath Iron its fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rugo or ruſt; whereby it is eroded and abſumed, in lieu of its fault, as it were, of effuſion of blood: for Iron tincted with blood, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently contracts ruſt.</p>
                           <p>There is a certain kinde of execrement which eructates out of Iron, which they ſometimes call its droſs, ſometimes its ſcales, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times its recrement, and ſometimes its dung: but thoſe are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly called Iron-ſcales, which break from it, while its beaten with hammers; and that its recrement or dung, which is elicited by ignition.</p>
                           <p>Many aſſert, That Iron-ruſt will cure Ulcers;
<note place="margin">Vires.</note> and that <hi>Telephus</hi> King of <hi>Myſia,</hi> wounded by <hi>Achilles,</hi> was thereby perſanated: for this, as alſo its droſs, aſtringe and ſiccate; whence they are mixed with Medicaments of a ſiccative faculty.</p>
                           <p>All Iron is roborative; and thence ſome waters become Medici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, which the Normans call Forgenſes, borrowing eximious ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues from Iron.</p>

                           <p>One <hi>Corn: Gemma,</hi> a Phyſician of <hi>Lovanium,</hi> ſaith, That a Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celſian Engliſh Medick, being himſelf and his wife detained by a Fever, took himſelf, and gave to his wife, that they call prepared Antimony; whereupon ſhe fell quickly diſtracted, and changed her life, yet valid, with death: He, complaining of dreams, and continual watchings, ſeven dayes after his dejection, began to dote and roave; from that he became Epileptical; from his Epilepſie he fell into a Lethargie, being therewithall ſomewhat Apoplectical; when he had been detained three dayes in that ſopour, he fell again to his roaving, and was ſo agitated with fury, that not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he expired, and paſſed from his conjugal bed, to his conjugal tomb.</p>
                           <p>Yet this Antimony is by ſome ſo artificially prepared,
<note place="margin">Vires.</note> that being opportunely given, it produces admirable effects: for an eximious ſudatory, inferiour to none, may be made of it. Neither is that Powder contemptible, which they call Flower of Stibium; for if it be prepared by perite, and exhibited by learned Artiſts, it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits much.

<note place="margin">Ceruſa, quid.</note> and Braſs its verdegreaſe; ſo hath Lead its Ceruſe, which ſome call the flower of Lead, and others, after <hi>Galen,</hi> Pſymmithion.</p>
                           <p>And although Ceruſe erupt like Verdegreaſe, by the benefit of Vinegar, yet is not green, but very white: whence Painters, to whom it is of much uſe, call it White-lead; and it is made after this or the like manner:</p>
                           <p>Sharp Vinegar is in the Summer-time infunded into a pot with a broad orifice, a plate of Red-Lead is ſuperimpoſed, and the veſſel
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:37350:274"/>ſo occluded, as nothing can expire. When the plate of Lead is taken off, which is moſt commonly on the tenth day, that craſſer matter that falls to the bottom of the veſſel, is collected and ſic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated: afterwards it is grinded with a Hand-mill, and ſifted, then coacted into a Maſſe or Paſtils with a little Vinegar, and preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
                           <p>It may alſo be made of Lead-duſt, immerged and reſolved by the ſpace of ten dayes in very ſharp Vinegar. It is ſometimes alſo made of the ſame Plates infuſed and deraded, and again macerated and deraded; the ſame again and again reiterated, till they be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved; then their raſure muſt be collected, brayed, ſifted, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted with Vinegar.</p>
                           <p>Painters do not onely ſeek after white Ceruſe, but women alſo, to fucate their faces; yet by its undue uſe, the teeth become black and worm-eaten, and the breath foetid. The beſt is that they call Rhodiaca, or that we now call Puteolis.</p>
                           <p>Ceruſe baked in a new earthen pot upon burning coals, will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire by uſtion a red colour, and ſo become Sandix, which is an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial Vermilion, and not Sandaracha, as ſome think.</p>
                           <p>Before Ceruſe ingrede the compoſition of Salves, Unguents, and Collyries, it ſhould be prepared, that is, waſhed, that it may deſiccate and aſtringe moderately, without any mordacity; and that in ſome fit liquor, as in ſimple water, or Roſe-water, thus:</p>
                           <p>Let a convenient quantity of Ceruſe be taken, and brayed in a ſtone-Morter with a wooden Peſtel; then let water be poured upon it; then let it ſtand till the Ceruſe be quiet in the bottom of the Morter; then abject the water: let more again be poured in; agitate it; then ſuffer it to reſide, and eject the water as before: then again pour new water in; and ſo let the work be iterated, till the water poured in and agitated, appear clear and pure, without filth.</p>
                           <p>Theſe duly performed, let the Ceruſe be laevigated on a red Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſtone; then dryed, and again brayed, and then formed into Paſtils with Roſewater, and repoſed for future uſes. Some bray it with Vinegar, and ſubact it into a maſſe; others with another li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor accommodated to their intentions.</p>
                           <p>Ceruſe refrigerates, ſiccates, aſtringes, extenuates, expletes,

                           <head>CHAP. 10. <hi>Of Cadmia, both factitious and foſsile.</hi>
                           </head>
                           <p>CAdmia, which the Arabians call Climia, is either foſſile and native, which is the ſtone out of which Braſs is drawn, and is
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:37350:275"/>called Braſs-Ore, which Artificers uſe in making yellow Braſs; which the ſhop-men call Aurichalcum, or Orichalcum; or elſe it is factitious.</p>
                           <p>The native is often found in Metal-Mynes: it is a yellow ſtone, very hard; appearing of two colours when it is not accended, but all over luteous when accended: and it is probable, this is the ſtone which <hi>Albertus</hi> calls Didachos, or the Devils-ſtone. The rivulets and torrents of <hi>Cyprus</hi> ſometimes afford ſuch a ſtone, which, being of many colours, ſome call it, The Rainbow-gemme; of which we have before ſpoken: but indeed it is neither the Rainbow nor Didachos.</p>
                           <p>Factitious Cadmia is a denſe body, concreted of the ſmoke of Braſs melted in a furnace, driven by the wind, and cleaving to the ſides and roof of the furnace. <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith, it is no matter whether we call it an earth or a ſtone; out of which, ſome Braſs, ſome Cad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia, and ſome Diphryges, is drawn: for the ſtone Pyrites burnt in a furnace, affords Cadmia.</p>
                           <p>There are five ſorts of factitious Cadmia:
<note place="margin">Vires.</note> the firſt is called Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pnitis, which is found in the very orifice of the furnace; which is ſo exuſt and tenuious, that it reſembles Embers: the ſecond is called Oſtraticls, which for the moſt part is black, and looks like a pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheard, being more grave, and therefore it delabes to the bottom of the furnace; and it is the moſt ſordid of all: <hi>Galen</hi> calls it <hi>Spodes</hi> or <hi>Spodium:</hi> the third and fourth are found in the middle of the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace, and they are called <hi>Placitis</hi> and <hi>Botrytis:</hi> Placitis is cruſty, and encompaſſed with ſegments, as with Zones; which is leſs pondrous, and adheres to the ſides of the furnace; under which Onichitis is found. Botrytis is moderately heavy, in face and colour like Spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium; which when broken, is cineritious and aeruginous. The firſt is as it were the thinner ſmoke of the Braſs, which adheres to the top of the furnace: of which hereafter.</p>
                           <p>All Cadmia is well and frequently had in the furnaces of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> which they make of that ſtone, which in dignity they call Cad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia: They make whiter Cadmia of Silver, but it is not compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to that of braſs.</p>
                           <p>Cadmia deſiccates gently,
<note place="margin">Vires.</note> abſterges, and helps humid and putrid Ulcers, and draws them to ſcars.</p>

                           <head>CHAP. 11. <hi>Of Spodium.</hi>
                           </head>
                           <p>NOthing is more frequently inculcated or heard in Pharmaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polies, and nothing leſs underſtood, then Spodium; which all the Apothecaries that I know, make of two ſorts: one coming from <hi>Greece,</hi> and another from <hi>Arabia;</hi> being in name one, but in nature very different: but that I may ſpeak plainly, there is no Arabian
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:37350:275"/>Spodium, but fictitious, as we ſaid before, and ſhall declare here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
                           <p>The Graecian Spodium, which is indeed the ſole Spodium, is found in braſs furnaces, with Pompholix, with which it hath much affinity: and it is then made, when micant ſparks aſcend from the Metal while it is cocting: and becauſe of their gravity delabe down again upon the pavement; which as they refrigerate, mix them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with filth: and hence this concreted heap of ſparkes is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinated, which they call Graecian Spodium, which is of uſe onely in external affections.</p>
                           <p>The Spodium of <hi>Avicenna,</hi> and the reſt of the Arabians, if any, is made of very diſſimilar matter, to wit, of the burnt roots of Canes; whereunto <hi>Avicenna</hi> attributes ſo many dowries, that I cannot but admire the mans credulity, or elſe ſimplicity, in writing; ſeeing it is contrary to reaſon, that that root by uſtion, which they call Spodium, ſhould recreate the heart, help againſt ſwounding, quench thirſt, allay the heat of the ſtomack, and cure the Palſey, Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and other diſeaſes he enumerates.</p>
                           <p>And grant we, that the Arabian Spodium can effect all theſe, yet we ought not to preſcribe it, becauſe it comes not at us. Apotheca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in its ſtead ſubſtitute burnt Ivory, calling it Spodium; whereas it is indeed rather Antiſpodium: as alſo that ſame they make of fig and Myrrhe-leaves burnt together, whereof <hi>Dioſcorides</hi> ſpeaks more at large.</p>
                           <p>But as crude Ivory differs much both in nature and faculties from crude Canes, ſo burnt alſo: for crude Ivory is better then burnt Ivory.</p>
                           <p>Seeing then the Arabian Spodium cannot be had; or if it could be had, would not anſwer to thoſe faculties <hi>Avicenna</hi> puts upon it, and we have no analogous ſubſtitute; it ſhould be expurgen from Medicinal receipts: for there is onely one; and that the Gaecian Spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium, which may not be aſſumed at the mouth.</p>
                           <p>The interpreters of the Barbarians language erre in tranſlating the Arabian <hi>Tabaxir,</hi> or the Indians <hi>Traeſir,</hi> Spodium; for <hi>Tabaxil,</hi> according to <hi>Garcias,</hi> is a Perſian word, denoting a lacteous liquor, or ſweet ſucce, which the Barbarians call <hi>Sacar Mamba;</hi> it is got in reeds, or rather trees, which are ſo great, that they can make many boats out of one; each whereof being excavated betwixt two knots, will hold two men, wherein the Indians ſail ſwiftly, and deſond themſelves from Crocodiles.</p>
                           <p>The ſucce of theſe trees is very black and cineritious, which they do not onely denominate Spodium, though falſly, but call it burnt aſhes by the ſame name; whereas Antiſpodium, according to <hi>Dioſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corides,</hi> is made of aſhes: for that the aſhes of Canes may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Antiſpodium, and be rightly ſubſtituted for defect of the Graeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Spodium, but not aſſumed at the mouth. Seeing now there is no <hi>Tabaxir</hi> of which they can make Spodium, but ridiculouſly burn Ivory for that purpoſe; we may admit of no Spodium but one,
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:37350:276"/>and that the Graecian, which is a kinde of factitious Cadmial; as alſo Pompholix, whoſe diſquiſition we ſhall now looke into.</p>

                           <p>POmpholix is a ſmall and volatile ſpark, which while Braſs is trying in the furnace, flies on high, and adheres to its ſupernal part. At firſt when it is made, it goes into bubbles and lumps, which by touching, are diſperged: for it is like white aſhes, and ſo light, that it eaſily flies up, and like duſt, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heres to the top of the furnace: and while this by its levity is elevated upward, another ſort of ſparks by their gravity delabe to the Pavement; which we call Spodium: ſo that both are made in one furnace, both have mutual cognation, and one may ſupply the defect of another.</p>
                           <p>Pompholix is by ſome Seplaſiaries called <hi>Nil,</hi> or <hi>Nihil;</hi> by other, The Cadmian Bubble; by the <hi>Mauritanians,</hi> Tuthia: whereof there are two varieties; one fat, which is of a brazen co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour; the other very white and light, which is leſs laudable: for <hi>Dioſcorides</hi> ſaith, That the Cyprian is beſt, which dipt in Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar, ſmells like Braſs, of the colour of Pitch, and taſting as dung.</p>
                           <p>But before it be uſed, it muſt be waſhed thus: The Pompho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lix muſt be bound in a pretty thin linen-cloth, and moved up and down in a veſſel full of limpid, pluvial, or fountain-water, that its more uſeful and tenuious part may flow into the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and the impurer and excrementitious remain in the cloth; then it muſt ſettle, and the water be effunded, and clean water affunded, and the cloth again agitated, till nothing that is uſeful be left therein. There are more wayes of its ablution deſcribed by <hi>Dioſcorides.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Pompholix is almoſt the beſt of all thoſe Medicaments which deſiccate without mordacity,

                           <p>LItharge is as it were the ſpume of Metals, purged by fire, or the tenuious recrement of Silver, purged from its Ceruſe, excuſſed and expelled by the help of bellows. And though its matter is multifarious, which ſome make Lead, others Silver, others Gold, and others Ceruſe; yet it draws its origine chiefly from Lead, which mixt with the recrements of Silver, and melted and cocted in the fire, is afterwards ſeparated; for all the recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Silver are eaſily ſeparated by fire: which, if they be plumbeous or aereous, as they are ordinarily, they may by coction be turned into Litharge; which, when cold, is ſometimes aure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, ſometimes argenteous, according to the brevity or diuturnity of its coction.</p>
                           <p>That which in colour reſembles Gold, is ſometimes called Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitis, ſometimes Celauritis; that which repreſents Silver, Argyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis: not becauſe this contains Silver in it, or the other Gold, but becauſe they have been each more or leſs cocted then other, or have received more or leſs of the aereous or argenteous va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour.</p>

                           <p>All Litharge then is the product of ſilver; and that which is flave like gold, is not made of gold, as ſome think, though it be thence cognominated Gold-Litharge: for degrees and intentions of heat, do not onely change the colour but intend or remit the heat, and vary the name. Thus Diphryges is named, as though it were twice cocted, which is the ſibſident droſs of perfect Braſs, cohering to the bottom of the furnace, like the aſhes of burnt wood: when the Braſs is taken away, after the the affuſion of water; and it is as ſharp as burnt Braſs, ſiccates vehemently, cures rebellious Ulcers; and it may be made two other wayes, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Dioſcorides</hi> and <hi>Pliny.</hi>
                           </p>

                           <p>Yet Chriſtis is preferred before all; which ſhould be purged from its Lead and droſs, before it ingrede the Compoſition of any Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cament: to which end <hi>Dioſcorides</hi> ſayes, it muſt be burnt, and waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed like Cadmia; but now they onely levigate it in a morter, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting clear water upon it, and agitating it, then they caſt it into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:37350:277"/>veſſel, and pouring more water upon it, agitate it again; and when it is again troubled, caſt it into the precedent veſſel, and ite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate its lotion, till the Lead and droſs ſubſide in the morter, and all its tenuions ſubſtance be educed, which they make to acquieſce, till all the ſincere and pure Litharge reſt at the bottom; which when the water is effunded, they collect and levigate upon a Marble, that the tongue may not perceive any aſperity therein.</p>

                           <hi>OUr Mother Nature hath produced nothing either imperfect, or in vain, but hath brought forth variety of Plants for the ſake of Animals, and ſeveral ſpecies of Animals for Plants: Many of them are ordained for Food and Nutriment; ſome, for Medicament; and other for Veſture. One Animal is an enemy to another, but all are ſubſervient to Man: For there is no Inſect, how vile and baſe ſoever, which doth not afford ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit to Man. For the moſt imperfect Creatures, uſually afford the moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Remedies; as, from Claws, Horns, Excrements, Blood, Fleſh, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, Teſticles, and Bones: Beſides, thoſe very wounds which are made by certain Animals, are cured by the Application of ſame part of the ſame Animal: Nay indeed, the whole Earth doth abound with innumerable Rendedies, for the variety of Maladies. What excellent Vertues do thoſe Medicines afford, which are derived from humane Bodies! of which firſt here we intend to ſpeak;</hi> viz. <hi>Of Mumy, and Man's Blood: whoſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties to emblazon, would require a larger Diſcourſe, then this our intend'd brevity will permit.</hi>

                        <p>Blood is Natures Treaſury, generated by heat in the greater Veins of the Liver, which is the prime organ of ſanguification, from the purer portion of Chyle; through which Veins it is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried as it were along tubes to the ſeveral parts of the body for their nutrition: and as long as it is herein contained, it is liquid and red; but when effunded, it preſently concretes: onely the blood of Harts and Does wanting fibres, concretes not, but remains fluid like Milk: for <hi>Hippocrates</hi> averres, That blood concretes not, when the fibres are taken away.</p>
                        <p>Now blood being the matter of the whole body, according to the Philoſopher; the blood of man, who is the rule of other Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, is fincere and thin, hot and moiſt, and the beſt of ſucces: yet it is not a ſimple humour, but participates of Phlegm, and both the Biles: And therefore <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſaith, That the four Humours are the matter of mans generation, as <hi>Galen</hi> atteſts (<hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de Temp.</hi>)</p>
                        <p>Blood then is an humour generated in the Liver, of a temperate part of Chyle, moderate in ſubſtance and qualities, in colour red, in ſapour ſweet, and naturally contained in Veins and Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, whereby it is directed to all parts (<hi>Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>de Part. Animal.</hi>) for as water is from one fountain and original, deduced into many ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulets, others ariſing from theſe, till the humour pervade all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions: ſo Nature hath directed blood through the whole body, it being the matter of the whole.</p>
                        <p>The blood of a diſeaſed or intemperate man, muſt not be collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and kept in ſhops, for the confection of any Emplaiſter; but from ſome temperate and ſound man, if it may be had; as the blood of ſuch as are beheaded: for their Veins and Arteries being cut to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, their veinous and arterious blood is promiſcuouſly col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected.</p>
                        <p>Yet neither the blood of this, or any other Animal, is of much value or vertue in the confecture of aſtrictive ſalves, becauſe by ſiccation and aſſervation, it neither retains any of its native bonity, nor yet aſſumes any excellent acquiſititious quality.</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>RHaſis</hi> and <hi>Avicenna</hi> contend, That <hi>Mumy</hi> is an Arabick word, denoting <hi>Piſſaphaltum; Iſaac</hi> ſaith, It is a Perſian word, ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying a certain liquor, found in Sepultures, where aromatized car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſes had been long reconded: one fellow calls it Cerops; upon what ground I know not, unleſs becauſe it hath the conſiſtency of Wax; for <hi>Num</hi> with the Perſians denotes Wax.</p>
                        <p>It is found onely in the Tombs of Aegyptian Kings and Nobles, who hearing of a Reſurrection, made their bodies be condited with Myrrhe, Cinnamome, Aloes, and other Spices, that they might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve them.</p>
                        <p>But many years after, when the Souldiors in time of Wars de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſtated all places, everting Sepulchres, they found in ſome coffins a certain odorate and pleaſant liquor, of the ſpiſſitude of honey; which, when the Aegyptian Medicks and Philoſophers judged upon good grounds to be indued with eximious faculties, they believed it might work the cure of ſome affections, and therefore they made tryal of it, and found the event anſwerable to their opinions; they reſtoring many to ſanity thereby.</p>
                        <p>They then being imboldened by this experience, ſought this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diture in other Noble-mens Sepulchers, which they inverted, and exhauſted: yea, they ſo much envied the happineſs of the dead mens bones, that they robbed poor mens coffins of their corruption: which cadaverous liquor they called Mumy, and gave it to the fick.</p>
                        <p>Nay, it was of ſo much fame preſently, that they would inſperge a little Salt and Alome on the carcaſes of ſuch as dyed of the French diſeaſe, Leproſie, or Scab, and after a few moneths collect their pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trid matter, and fell it for Mumy: and, what is more horrible, they would take the dead carcaſes of ſuch as had been ſuffocated and dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the ſands of <hi>Arabia,</hi> and call them Mumy, and give them to the diſeaſed, to be aſſumed at the mouth.</p>
                        <p>Yea, many are in that errour ſtill, that Mumy is onely the cada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verous and dry fleſh of bodies corrupted and putrid. Yea, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member I heard a man of much learning, but no great skill in Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, amongſt a company of famous men, ſpeaking of Mumy, and all contending, that now we had no true Mumy, but a little ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid, foetid, corrupt fleſh, in reſpect of that which was found in the Aegyptian Kings Sepulchres, which was both fragrant and vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, ſay, That Mumy was the fleſh of dryed bodies; and that he had ſeen it lately dryed, while it was adherent to the ribs.</p>
                        <p>Thus this impious opinion adheres to the mindes of the eredu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, who collecting ſome filthy matter from mans fleſh, a wicked cuſtome indeed, introduced by wretched men, exhibit it to the ſick.
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:37350:279"/>We are ſo farre from poſſeſſing the Mumy of the ancient Aegypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
<note place="margin">Mumia an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquorum non amplius haberi.</note> which was but ſmall, and ſoon ſpent, that we cannot have <hi>Avicenna</hi> his Mumy, which was made of mans corruption, mixed with Piſſaphaltum, but are content with the ſucce expreſſed out of putrid carcaſes, and inſpiſſated, which is now kept in Pharmaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polies, to mens greateſt peril; which perite and prudent men never uſe in Medicine: for it is abſurd to think, that this Mumy ſhould help ſuch as are hurt by falling; nay, will it not rather harm them; and all that uſe it? for if we fear that any ones blood ſhould clot by falling, have we not Poſca and Oxymel, and other inciding Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments more conducible?</p>
                        <p>But ſeeing no Compound in our Shop requires mans Fat, no more of that.</p>

                        </head>
                        <p>GOats are either peregrine and cornuted, as the Aethiopian and Cretian; Goats; or vernacular: ſome whereof have horns, others not: The blood of either, duly prepared, as we have taught in our Shop, is very effectual in breaking the ſtone; and is the baſis of that eximious Medicament we call <hi>Lithos Tripticos,</hi> to whoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment we have adjoyned this Preparation.</p>
                        <p>Now there are many varieties of peregrine Goats; amongſt which, the Perſian Goat, which they call, <hi>Pazan,</hi> is moſt commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, out of whoſe belly the Bezar-ſtone is taken, which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended againſt the virulent bitings of Animals, Poyſons, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny malignant Diſeaſes, as we ſhall declare more at large by and by.</p>
                        <p>The Cretian Goat, is ſo called from the Iſle <hi>Crete,</hi> which nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes no Wolves, no more then <hi>England:</hi> the French call it <hi>Bouceſtain:</hi> it is veſted with ſhort and flave hair, bearing two horns crooked backwards; it is ſo agile an Animal, that it will leap from one rock to another, though ſix paces diſtant. <hi>Bellonius.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Amongſt wilde-Goats, we enumerate Mountain-Goats, Rock-Goats, African-Goats, Bucks, and Roe-bucks; and yet theſe Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals differ much from one another, and all from our indigenous Goat, which alone of Animals patiently and willingly admits a companion in venery: whence by a Sarcaſm we call him a Cornuto, Goat-like, that patiently tolerates it.</p>
                        <p>Strepſicetos is by ſome called a Goat; but I rather think it a Ram: it hath two horns ſtriated, but like the Unicorns horns erect, never uſed in Medicine.</p>
                        <p>Strepſiceros, brings me to think of Monoceros, which many douht is a meer Chimaera: for, if it have a being, it is ſo rare, that it never was ſeen; and becauſe it is rare, becauſe its nature is unknown; and becauſe that ſuch as write of it, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:37350:279"/>amongſt themſelves, men doubt of its being.</p>
                        <p>Yet that there is ſuch a Beaſt, the holy Scriptures averre, and its horn, which is daily ſeen, and preſcribed by Medicks againſt poyſons and poyſonous affections: Yet I ſet no leſs eſtimate upon Harts or Rhinoceros his horn, then Monoceros his horn, of which many write more then truth. What kinde of Animal it is, of what nature, where it lives, and what vertues its horn is indued with, ſhall be hereafter more largely explicated.</p>

                        <p>BOth wiſe men aſſert, and experience proves, That Hares blood roſted breaks the ſtone. This Animal is moſt notorious, moſt fearful, and ſwifteſt; which alone, according to <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> hath hair in its mouth, and under its feet. Some ſay they have ſeen white Hares; but it is certain, that they are not ſo, onely they appear ſuch in winter, while they are covered with ſnow, as with a white garment.</p>
                        <p>One <hi>D. de Vitri,</hi> an eximious Noble-man, catch'd a cornuted Hare, whoſe horns he gave King <hi>James</hi> of <hi>England.</hi> It is fabulous, that Hares participate of both Sexes hermaphroditically, and that they can both beget, conceive, and bear.</p>
                        <p>And the blood is not onely ſo efficacious, but the whole Hare uſted in an earthen pot well covered, and taken with ſome White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wine, water, or fit decoction, breaks and expels ſtones, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore rightly accedes to Lithontripticons confection.</p>

                        <p>A Hart is a well-known Animal, which ſuperates all other cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nigerous beaſts, both in pulchritude of form, amplitude of horns, and variety of branches: But nature denied horns to Deer; and thoſe that firſt erupt out of the Male, are erect without branches: whence the Bucks are called <hi>Subulones:</hi> afterwards their horns are bifidous, afterwards trifidous: they are at firſt veſted with a skin,
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:37350:280"/>and ſoft Down; but after they are expofed a while to the Sun, they become rough, hard, and glabre.</p>
                        <p>All cornigerous Animals, except the Hart, bear hollow horns; but his are all over ſolid, which fall off yearly; and then being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed, he hides himſelf daily, till new ones erupt; and theſe cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles are as roborative, and as much reſiſt venenate affections, as Monoceros his horn. Experience hath alſo proved, That a Harts genitals are very efficacious in curing the Pleuriſie, Collick, and Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentery. There is a certain concreted liquor, Gumme-like, which we call Harts-tears, in the greater angle of an old Harts eye, which by an admirable propriety moves ſudour copiouſly, and oppugnes the venenate quality of the Peſtilence, and other malign af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections.</p>
                        <p>Eutyceros and Platyceros are a kinde of Harts: But I leave the nature of them to be deſcribed by ſuch as undertake the abſolute Hiſtory of Animals.</p>

                        <p>MArrow, Suet, Fat, and Greaſe, have much cognation each with other, which are onely found in Animals indued with blood, but not all in all; for ſome are onely proper to ſome beaſts, as Suet to cornigerous Animals, Fat to ſome cloven-footed Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, all Birds, and many four-footed Beaſts; which is that ſame which the French, when ſalted, call <hi>Vicil oing;</hi> when freſh, <hi>Saing doulx.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now Suet differs from Fat or Greaſe, in that it is fragile, and concretes by cold; whereas Greaſe is liquid, and may not be hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: they differ alſo in place; for Fat is found betwixt the skin and fleſh, Suet alwayes in the panicle about the Reins; and in the end is fleſh.</p>
                        <p>Thoſe Animals whoſe blood is more corpulent, have more of Suet; for Suet, according to the Philoſopher, is terrene; and hence it is coagulated like fibrous blood: wherefore, ſuch cornigerous Animals as are not toothed on both ſides, being by nature dry and terrene, are pregnant with Suet; but ſuch as are not cornige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and yet toothed on both ſides, have Fat in its ſtead, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not terrene, is not coagulated.</p>
                        <p>Therefore Suet being made more terrene then Fat, is therefore taken for the Confection of <hi>Unguenti Citrinum;</hi> if it be not the Fat of a Goat, or a Ram, or a Kid; for thoſe are proper: Concerning which, to ſpeak more words is in vain.</p>

The greaſe of hotter Animals, as of Lyons, is more efficacious in reſolving: for a Swine is not intemperate in the firſt qualities, and therefore it waxes ſo ſoon fat, and is ſo multiparous, being ſtimulated to venery, and exerciſing congreſs before the year end. Its Snout is repanded, its neck ſhort and crafs, hiſpid with rigid briſtles: the Males reſticles, which are not long, hang be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde, as in other four-footed Animals: its teeth are long and ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; but the Female want ſuch fangs, or at leaſt they are not ſo perſpicuous: both of them have intorted tails; as alſo a Boar, which is a wilde Swine.</p>

                        <p>A Bear is an Animal of a horrid aſpect and vociferation; for its voice is iracund, minacious, and full of terror: its mouth is very patulous, its teeth ſerrated, its noſtrils wide, its ears decur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated, its whole body rough, with prolix hairs, and its tail ſo ſhort, as it can ſcarce be perceived.</p>
                        <p>The She-Bear is very venereous, often ſollicitating the Male to congreſs, lying on her back, and amplecting him: her young is not without form till ſhe lick them, as it is commonly credited: which error <hi>Scaliger</hi> diſproves, (<hi>Exer.</hi> 15. <hi>contra Cardan.</hi>)</p>

                        <p>ALl Greaſes are ſomewhat ingrateful, ſubverting the ventricle, except Gooſe greaſe, which participating of ſome ſuavity, is more expetible in culinary matters; and it is much celebrated in Pharmacopolies: alſo being adhibited alone to the ear, againſt that noiſe that precedes hardneſs of hearing; and is alſo mixed with many other reſolvent Medicaments.</p>
                        <p>A Gooſe is both carnivorous, and frugivorous, converſant both in watery and plain places, both domeſtick and wilde, changing its ſeat and ſoly at certain times; they fly by companies like Cranes.</p>
                        <p>Some ſuperſtitiouſly believe, That Geeſe are as good keepers as Dogs, becauſe one by chance ſaved the Capitol, awaking the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers with its profound clamour; who ſeeing a few French-men aſcending the walls with Ladders, fell upon them with violence, and routed them. For which benefit, the Romans held Geeſe ſacred a long time: But after a while, depoſing this Superſtition, they uſed Geeſe in their Banquets; they yielding very laudable alimony and odour when they are roſted, and grateful ſapour when eaten: Some refer Swans, and the like, to this kinde: but Cooks have more to do therewith then Apothecaries.</p>

                        <p>Ducks Greaſe is alſo of uſe in Medicine, which we adhibit by it ſelf to the dolour of the joynts, and mixed with other Medicaments and Salves, to the cold diſtemper of the nerves; for it is mollitive, calefactive, reſolvent, and anodynous.</p>
                        <p>A Duck is of the kinde of whole-footed Birds; which whether domeſtick or wilde, equally delights in dry and in moiſt places. Some of the domeſtick Ducks are all white, others all black, others like Piets, partly white, partly black; and others ſubcineritious, as all wilde ones are.</p>
                        <p>Drakes, whether domeſtick or wilde, are greater, and more va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riegated in colour, then Ducks; eſpecially about their wings and necks, where their Plumes are mixed with a caeruleouſly green.</p>
                        <p>The fleſh of fat wilde-Ducks, though hard, is ſweet, and gets good blood; but that of the domeſtick is more excrementitious and inſuave, for they feed upon unwholeſome edibles; as guts, and often Toads, which they ſometimes ſwallow whole.</p>
                        <p>Many think, that the Pontian Ducks feed upon poyſons: whence
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:37350:281"/>
                           <hi>Mithridates</hi> mixed their blood with Antidotes againſt poyſon: they live for the moſt part in Rivers, Lakes, and Fenny places. Many other Birds, as Teals, and the like, are referred to this kinde.</p>

                        <p>CApons greaſe is of a middle nature, betwixt Swines and Gooſe greaſe: when freſh,
<note place="margin">Vires.</note> it is good againſt the affections of the Womb; it conduces alſo to the clefts in the lips, dolours of the ears, and ſwellings of the paps: when it is old, it califies and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves more potently.</p>
                        <p>A Hen is of Birds moſt uſeful to man, and moſt foecund: for beſides her fleſh, which ſhe gives to him for meat, ſhe alwayes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilits moſt commodious ſoeture; for they daily either lay or ſit on Egges, or exclude Chickens; which, while very young, are deſired by ſome; when more adult, pleaſant to all palates; and when ſaginated and caſtorated, fit for Courtiers.</p>
                        <p>For this kinde of fleſh, is of all moſt eaſie of concoction, of the beſt ſucce, and moſt idoneous for all natures and temperaments. I do not approve of their ſentence, who rather preſcribe the broth of an old Cock, which is alwayes maculent, then of a young one ſat and good, to their Patients. I prefer the broth of a Capon or fat Hen, before this; and if there be neceſſity of ſome nitrous quality, I would ſeek it elſwhere; for all Cocks are fleſhleſs and ſucceleſs; but eſpecially old ones, becauſe they have ſpent all their laudable ſucce in venery.</p>
                        <p>We have three ſorts of men; one whereof ſuperates the reſt in magnitude, whoſe bills and feet are lureous, which lay greater Egges, and are leſs foecund; as the <hi>Londunian</hi> Hens, which <hi>Varro</hi> calls Medical, becauſe they were brought from <hi>Media.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Others are ſmaller, with criſped feathers, which fall off more thence once in a year; ſo that they are ſometimes implumeous in winter: others are the vulgar, which are continually veſted with feathers; ſome whereof are black, which are thought the beſt; others white, the worſt; and others variegated, which are thought to be in a mean.</p>
                        <p>Some preſcribe the interiour tunicle of a Hens ſecond ventricle, to ſuch as have weak ſtomacks, to help the coctive faculty; but without anſwerable ſucceſs: for its temper is vitiated by the Hens death and deſiccation, and its coctive quality periſhed; for it is certain, that there are many things in an Animal, when living, that periſh by death.</p>
                        <p>Beſides, there are many more Countrey Hens, as the Water-Hen, and the Mountain-Hen, called Modcock, or Woodcock.</p>
                        <p>There are alſo peregrine-Hens, as Turkey-Hens, and Phaſians, and Meleagrian, or African-Hens, whoſe variegated colour gave
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:37350:282"/>a name to a certain Herb, bearing a variouſly maculated flower.</p>
                        <p>And as the colour of many birds is various, ſo of their egges alſo; as the egges of Partridges, Pey-hens, Turkey-hens; but ours are alwayes white, as alſo the egges of our Geeſe, Ducks, and Stock-doves.</p>
                        <p>We often uſe egges in Medicine; for we ſolve yolks in Glyſters, and we can ſcarce waſh Turpentine with their adjument: we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract Oyl out of them, when hardned; and we have an eximſous Electuary denominated from egges, which is much commended againſt the Plague.</p>
                        <p>But we uſe them moſt in Cibaries: for <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſaith, They have ſomething of ſtrength in them, becauſe they are the matter of Animals; they nouriſh, becauſe they are the Milk of Chickens; and they increaſe, becauſe they diffuſe themſelves much.</p>
                        <p>Soft egges are moſt nutritive; hard and fryed egges, bad: Hens, Phaſians, and Partridges egges, the beſt of the kinde.</p>

                           <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith, An egge admits onely of one pravity, and that comes by age, which you may eſchew, if you take them while new.</p>

                        <p>OUt of the more terrene part of the Milk, we have Cheeſe; and out of the fatter, which we call Cream, by much agitation in a Churn, comes Butter, which is had in delight by many Nations, becauſe it affects the palate with its ſuavity; as Normaniſh Butter, which the Incoliſts condite with Salt in earthen Pots, and ſend into all parts of <hi>France,</hi> where it ſupplies the place of Oyl; for it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends the ſapour of many diſhes, and makes them more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petible.</p>
                        <p>It is uſefully mixed to the Eclegm <hi>de Pineis,</hi> and many extrinſecal Medicaments inſtituted to leniſie, humectate, mollifie, and allay dolours: for, being hot and oleous, it helps the diſeaſe in the groyns; and Impoſtnumes in the head: It cocts humours lodging in the breaſt, by way of liniment, and ſolves the ventricle; but eſpecially the Butter of Cows Milk, which is more copious, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſweeter, and wholeſomer: for ſome make Butter of Sheep and Goats-milk, but that we do not approve of.</p>
                        <p>Now this vaccineous kinde is diſtinguiſhed by four degrees in age: the firſt is of Calves, the ſecond of Heiſers, the third of young Kine, and the fourth of old ones. The Herdſmen call a bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren Cow <hi>Taura,</hi> and a pregnant one <hi>Horda,</hi> or <hi>Forda.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Cattel change the habit of their bodies, colour of their hairs, and nature, according to the ſtate and condition of the ſoyl and heavens in ſeveral Regions. Hence Aſiatical Cattel have one
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:37350:282"/>form, Epyrean another, and French another.</p>
                        <p>Cattel, whether Male or Female, are cornigerous; yet in <hi>Myſia,</hi> and about <hi>Maeotis,</hi> they have no horns; and in <hi>India</hi> they have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times but one horn apiece, and others three horns. The <hi>Aonian</hi> Cow hath but one horn in the middle of its forehead, Unicorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like.</p>
                        <p>There are more varieties of Oxen and Kine; which to diſcuſs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly, appertains not to us: for, it is enough if we ſay, That Milk and Butter, whereof we have ſome uſe in Pharmacy, comes of Kine; for Milk doth not onely nouriſh, as it is white blood, but cure many affections of the Dyſentery, Conſumption, and vices of the Lungs; for which, Aſſes Milk is beſt, next to Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.</p>
                        <p>Cattel ſuppeditate ſo many and ſo great commodities to man, that they can ſcarce be enumerated: for, the Ox is not onely his companion in his Labour and Agriculture while he lives, but when killed, his Tables ornament, and his own firm and laudable aliment.</p>
                        <p>To this family we may refer Buffs, Bugles, wilde Oxen, and Aethiopian Bulls: The deſcription of whoſe nature, I leave to them that write the perfect Hiſtory of Animals.</p>

                        <p>CAſtor Caſtorium, is apt and expetible for many Medicinal uſes. Now a Caſtor is an amphibious Animal, whitely ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neritious, and black on the back, living partly on the water, and partly on the earth, ſucking meat from both places, like an Otter; to which it is very like, except in its tail; which is glabre, broad, and ſquamous, Fiſh-like; but the Otters is long, round, hiſpid, and yellow, as its whole body is alſo.</p>
                        <p>There are many Caſtors about the rivers in <hi>Pontus,</hi> and alſo in the ſens in <hi>Spain;</hi> but their ſtones have not the ſame faculty with them of <hi>Galatia.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Caſtor will bite horridly; for if it catch hold of a man, it will not let the part go, till it feel and hear the broken bones crack, and rub one againſt another: its teſticles are chiefly Medicinal; which it doth not bite off with its own teeth, when purſued by hunters, as it is ſabulouſly ſtoryed of it.</p>

                        <p>SOme Animals are hunted and taken for meat, as Harts, Hares, and Boars; others for Medicine, as Vipers; others for plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and odorament, as the Musk and Civet-Cat; the Beaver alſo and Badger, for Medicaments and veſture.</p>
                        <p>Musk is the name of an excrement, and of the Animal whoſe excrement it is: the Animal is exotical, being in <hi>India</hi> in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Pegu,</hi> not much unlike a ſhe-goat, with a praegrand body: they call it the Musk-Buck, the Musk-Roe, and the Musk-Goat; out of whoſe inferiour jaw, there erupts as many teeth, and as great as them of Hogs.</p>
                        <p>When this beaſt is moved with venery, her umbilical region ſwells through the vehemency of her fury; and there much craſs blood being congeſted, makes up an impoſthume, and then the fierce Animal refuſes all meat and drinks, convolving it ſelf along the ground, and rubbing the part ſwelled againſt trees and ſtones with
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:37350:283"/>pleaſure, till it breaks and opens its bladder; out of which, corrupt matter runs, which is true Musk; of all things, the moſt odorate and ſuaveolent, in bonity much ſuperating all the varieties of Musk we ſee.</p>
                        <p>This corruption left upon ſtones, and trunks of trees, is by the heat of the Sun, and influence of the heavens, cocted and elabora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and its foetid odour, if it had any, diſſipated; and ſo it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes moſt excellent Musk, which none but Kings and Noble-Men obtain. But that which is ordinarily ſold, is far inferiour, being drawn from Animals catched by hunting. For when the hunters catch this beaſt, they abſcind its hide, with ſome fleſh; expreſs, collect, exſiccate its blood, with its utricles and skin; whoſe dryed blood, mixed with a ſmall portion of its recrements, they ſell for pure Musk.</p>
                        <p>There is a kinde of greater Weaſel, which being Martial and pugnaceous, they call <hi>Martes</hi> (for it kills great Hens ſometimes) whoſe excrements, as I have oft obſerved, ſmell like Musk.</p>
                        <p>There are alſo ſome plants and fruits, which affect the noſtrils and palate with this Musky ſuavity; as ſweet-Storks bill, Musk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe, and Pears, that ſavour of Musk.</p>
                        <p>The faculties of Musk are eximious; for it roborates and exhila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates a cold and fearful heart, and conduces to all its affections; it alſo recreates the brain, and refreſhes the ſpirits: it is hot in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cand, and dry in the third degree.</p>

It is a wilde Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal, with horrid teeth, not ſo like a Cat as many write; for it is greater, exceeding in magnitude ſometimes a Wolf: its head, neck, feet, and other parts, are very unlike a Cat's; its mouth is long; like a Badgers mouth; its body long; its inferior jaw white, as alſo its beard; its feet black; the lateral parts of its belly white; its back obſcurely cineritious, and ſomewhat maculated; its excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is called Civet: which for its fragrancy rich men deſire, and for its efficacy Medicks celebrate.</p>
                        <p>Civet then is an odorament different from Musk, moſt ſweet, fat, traſſe, and blackiſh, deſumed from an Animal, thence called Civet-Cat: for, it is the ſudour of this beaſt, concreting about its teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles and privities; which men erade with a Spoon.</p>
                        <p>It is an Indian Animal, now cicurated, and frequent in <hi>Europe,</hi> daily ſeen, and kept in many mens houſes in <hi>Lutetia.</hi> Now that it may ſuggeſt more abundance of this recrement, it muſt be irritated,
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:37350:284"/>wearied, and provoked to anger; for then its genitals will emit much ſudour, which they afterwards erade. At firſt when deraded, it is graveolent to ſome men; but when it is concreted, and expoſed to the air, it depoſes its virulency, and acquires a moſt grateful ſuavity.</p>
                        <p>As its odour challenges affinity with Musk; ſo alſo doth its qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity:
<note place="margin">Vires.</note> but it moſt conduces to the ſtrangulation of the Uterus, if a few of its grains be impoſed into the cavity of the Navel.</p>
                        <p>Both Patients and Phyſicians eſchew the dung of Animals, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of its foetour and ingrateful ſapour: and ingenuous men had rather ſeek, handle, and exhibit Medicaments, then putrid ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements. Yet Mouſe-dung, with white-wine, is good to break and exclude the ſtone; Dogs-dung cures the Quinſie; Mans dung is much commended in ſwellings: Nothing is ſo good a cure for the Epilepſie, which comes from the conſent of the inferior parts, and aſcent of the more tenuious matter to the head, as Peacocks-dung. But ſeeing ſuch excrements ingrede not the compoſition of our Medicaments, we will not trouble our ſelves with them.</p>

<note place="margin">Iſopus, quid</note> extracted by art and concreted, whereof <hi>Phyliagrus</hi> makes a ſalve called Oeſya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nun; which is commended to the dolours of the Spleen, the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Stomack and Liver, and Nodoſities of other parts: for this greaſe expletes and mollifies,
<note place="margin">Vires.</note> eſpecially the Ulcers of the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Matrix, with honey and butter: it califies without exceſs, and allayes dolour.</p>

                        <p>Then the wooll being compreſſed and removed, that fat and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did water is poured from on high, that it may cauſe much ſpume; which ſpume they agitate ſo long in the water, till none be left.</p>
                        <p>This done, they collect the pinguetude, and waſh it, agitating it with their hands in pure water, till it will neither aſtringe, nor bite the tongue much, and till it appear white; then they repoſe it in an earthen veſſel: and all this ſhould be done in the hot Sun. Some adde Sea-water to the lotion; but this way is beſt.</p>
                        <p>Sheep are known to all Nations, ſuppeditating infinite commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities to men; with whoſe wooll they are veſted, with whoſe fleſh they are nouriſhed, and with whoſe dung their fields become fat and foecund.</p>

                        <p>IF Animals excrements, which are foetid, be indued with a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendititious faculty to the cure of ſome affections; as Dogs dung, which ſome Merry Blades call <hi>Album Graecum,</hi> to the Quinſie; then much more their integrant parts; as the Elks claws to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pilepſie, Goats claws to ſuch as piſſe their beds, and the bones of many fiſhes, birds and beaſts, to other diſeaſes.</p>
                        <p>Mans bone is alſo Mans Medicine; for a mans Scull unbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, duly prepared, and exhibited, cures the Falling-ſickneſs. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience alſo ſhews, That a Harts heart-bone, a Rhinocerots horn, Elephants, Boars, and Pikes teeth, conduce to many diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes.</p>
                        <p>A Hart much augments Medicinary Materials; for thereunto it ſuggeſts its Horns, Suet, Fat, Marrow, Lachryma, Yard, and that Oſſicle which is found in the baſis of its heart.</p>
                        <p>A Hart is a moſt noble Animal, ſuperating almoſt all others in pulchtitude, celerity, dignity, and utility; and hence Kings onely, or their Servants, were wont to hunt them. Their fleſh alſo adoms large banquets; and that which is inconvenient for Tables, locu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletates Apothecaries Shops.</p>
                        <p>But that Oſſicle which adheres to the baſis of an old Harts heart,
<note place="margin">Vires.</note> is moſt celebrated; which from its figure much reſembling a croſs, hunters call the Harts croſs; which they by experience, and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothecaries by reaſon, have found very conducible to the affections of the heart.</p>
                        <p>Young Harts have onely a cartilage, no bone.</p>
                        <p>In inveterate Harts, there concretes a certain lachryma in the larger angle of their eyes, which admirably produces ſudour, and conduces to venenate diſeaſes, as we ſhewed before; This hearts bone ingredes the confection of Diamoſchum, that it may make it more cordial and officacious.</p>

                        <p>THe Elephant is of four-footed beaſts the greateſt, and moſt obſequious to man; for it doth not onely obey him, but his voice, taking and doing his commands: yea, ſome would anſwer their Maſters commanding them, with <hi>hoo, hoo,</hi> that is, in the barbarous Idiome, <hi>I will, I will.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Aelianus</hi> ſaw one writing Latine Letters, ſtraight, and in order, upon a table; but his teachers hand was underneath, directing the Animal to the figure and lineament: and when the Elephant
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:37350:285"/>wrote, its eyes were fixed, and dejected, Grammarian-like, on his Maſter.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Oppianus</hi> ſaith, That it is an old Proverb, That Elephants talk with one another, but cannot be underſtood by any man, ſave their Tamers.</p>
                        <p>Elephants come ſo near mans ingeny, that they are judged more pradent then men in ſome places.</p>
                        <p>They are obſequious, deſirous of glory, mindeful of benefits and injuries received, and deſirous of retribution or revenge.</p>
                        <p>That of <hi>Aelianus</hi> is known, how an Elephant ſeeing his Maſter take ſome of his due from him, and put it in his pot; when he was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by his Maſter, to take care that his corn ſhould be reaped and prepared, ſtole a good part of his barley, putting little ſtones in in its ſtead, and ſo gave his Maſter his due meaſure and wonted heap, and kept enough for himſelf: thus craftily vindicating him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for his former injury.</p>
                        <p>He hath ſmall eyes in reference to his great body; he hath a long Snout, in ſtead of a Noſe, which he uſes in ſtead of a hand, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in aſſuming and ingeſting meat and drink; he hath a very ſmall tongue; four ſhort and craſs teeth on each jaw, wherewith he breaks and mollifies his aliment; and two very long and very craſs ones, which are liker horns: theſe fall out at ſet times, and grow again.</p>
                        <p>And the matter of theſe is Ivory, which is accommodated to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite uſes, eſpecially Medicinal.</p>
                        <p>And this is that which many Apothecaries burn, and erroneouſly conceit to be the Arabian factitious Spodium.</p>
                        <p>And yet it cannot be rightly ſubſtituted for Spodium, neither when burnt, nor crude; for by uſtion its vertue periſhes: and when it is crude, it is no wayes analogal to Spodium: for in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per locution, there is onely one kinde of Spodium, <hi>viz.</hi> the Grae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian Spodium, which they call Pompholix.</p>
                        <p>But the Arabian's falſly ſuppoſed Spodium, is <hi>Tabaxir,</hi> which agrees as much with burnt Ivory, as Sugar with Rhabarbe: of which we have more largely diſſerted elſewhere.</p>
                        <p>Crude Ivory hath many eximious faculties: for,
<note place="margin">Vires.</note> it roborates all bowels, refrigerates and aſtringes moderately, aligates the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours of the ſtomack, cohibits vomiting, kills worms, liberates from diuturnal obſtructions; and drunk, makes women more apt to conceive.</p>

                        </head>
                        <p>IF any Animals naturally void of horns, be by chance ſeen cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuted, we think them monſtrous, as the ruſtick <hi>Caenomanus,</hi> on whoſe front grew a craſs horn of two palmes length, incurvated to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the hinder part of his head; which we ſaw for a miracle in <hi>Paris,</hi> in the year 1600. I never heard of the like, ſave of one man, that <hi>Philippus Ingraſsias</hi> makes mention of, who had a horn on his back.</p>
                        <p>Yet there are many cornigerous Animals, eſpecially of the Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde, bicornuted, as the Ox, and Goat; others tricornuted, as ſome Indian Oxen; and ſome quadricornuted, as I have ſeen ſome Rams.</p>
                        <p>Some alſo bear but one horn, as the Indian Aſſe; ſome Kine in <hi>Zeila of Aethiopia;</hi> the amphibious Animal Camphur, frequent in the Iſles of <hi>Molucca;</hi> alſo ſome Aethiopian Birds, and ſome Fiſhes; as the Uletif, frequent in the Indian Sea.</p>
                        <p>But that Animal celebrated not onely in humane but divine Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, which the Hebrews call <hi>Rem</hi> and <hi>Reem; Avicenna, Acherche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den;</hi> the Arabian, <hi>Barkaran;</hi> the Greeks, <hi>Monoceros;</hi> the Latins, <hi>Unicornis;</hi> the Indians, <hi>Cartazontes;</hi> the French, <hi>Licornia;</hi> and we <hi>Unicorne,</hi> excels all theſe in dignity.</p>
                        <p>Divers Authors have written variouſly of this Animal; ſome making it tall, others low; ſome wild and ſylveſtrian, others not onely cicurated by art, but tamed by the ſight of a Girle; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times lying to ſleep beſide her, as being delighted with her love and odour: ſome make its horn black, others yellow, and others white.</p>
                        <p>Yet they who have luſtrated the New-found world, ſay, that an Unicorn is lower and ſlenderer then an Elephant, equalizing in magnitude an ordinary Horſe; of a muſteline or yellowiſh colour; and ſome ſay, ſubcineritous, with a Harts head, no long neck, a ſhort Mane, rare, and hanging on one ſide; a rough beard, but ſhort; bifideous hoofes, not thick legs, and a tail like a Boar. <hi>(Solin. Plin. Aelian.)</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It bears its horn, which is ſtraight, craſs, intorted, four or five foot long, according to its age; ſolid, hard, ſquamous, yet not cleft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; yellowiſh without, eburneous within, but not undulated with any lines, and obvallated with a kinde of craſs skin, dirempted in circular line from other parts, which Merchants ineptly call its Lard.</p>
                        <p>Seeing then that an Unicorn is an Animal both rare and wilde, not cicurable, unleſs it be caught while very young, and its horns do not fall off annually, as Harts-horns do; it is no wonder if its horn be ſo rare and precious: yet there is one exceeding a mans procerity,
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:37350:286"/>kept as a rich treaſure in St. <hi>Dionyſius</hi> his Temple beſide <hi>Paris,</hi> and many little pieces in every <hi>Pariſian</hi> Pharmacopoly, that ſuch may be helped as require its exhibition.</p>
                        <p>It is much commended againſt poyſon,
<note place="margin">Vires.</note> and to exhilarate and ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borate the Noble parts; and therefore it is given to the peſtilent, and ſuch as are infected with contagious and venenate diſeaſes: yet all patients being not equally rich, it is onely exhibited to the richer; to others I preſcribe Rhinoceros, and Harts-horn, with no leſs ſucceſs.</p>

                        <p>THe Bezaar-ſtone is either ſo called from an oriential Animal out of which it is had, which the Perſians call <hi>Paſan,</hi> and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>Bazar,</hi> and the Indians <hi>Bezar;</hi> or elſe from is Bezardical, that is, alexiterial faculty, wherein it is eximious againſt poyſon: and upon that account, a certain Metalline alexiterian ſtone, is by ſome Arabians called Bezardical, becauſe they ſay the Bezaar-ſtone will expugne all poyſons.</p>
                        <p>But this Bezaar-ſtone now in frequent uſe, is not effoded out of Mynes, but taken out of the belly and internals of a certain Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal, moſt frequent in <hi>Perſia, Coraſo,</hi> and the promontory of <hi>Comorim,</hi> near <hi>Chyma,</hi> which ſuch as have have ſeen it call a Goat; the incoliſts call it a Mountain-Goat; for in form and magnitude it reſembles an European Goat, but its hair is ſhorter; it is taller, equalizing a Hart in procerity: and it ſeems to be rightly denominated Hart-Goat, becauſe it partly bears the nature of a Hart, partly of a Goat.</p>
                        <p>It is a moſt agile, ſwift, and fierce Animal, eaſily leaping from rock to rock, and ſometime turning upon the Indian hunters, and killing them; it hath bifidous ungles, like a Goat, ſlender legs, a prominent and ſhort tail, a rough body Goat-like, but ſhorter hair, cineriouſly yellow, like a Hart; a Goats head armed with two horns crooked backwards, and ending in an obtuſe point, very black and hollow, in their craſſer part, obſited with many tubercles: I ſaw two at <hi>Cowbertum</hi> in the Caſtle of <hi>Dom. de Virty.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The aforeſaid ſtone is generated in this Animals belly; whoſe magnitude, form and colour, are various, according to the nature and age of the Beaſt; for there are greater ſtones in the greater and elder beaſt, leſſer in the leſſer and younger; all are of an oval figure, but ſome rounder then others, and others more quadrate.</p>
                        <p>Their colour is obſcure and blackiſh, or yellow, and more pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid, according to the Animals temperature; whereof ſuch as gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate greater and craſſer ſtones, are leſs agile, and leſs apt to run or leap, which live more ſadly, and are at the firſt ſight known by hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. Perhaps theſe ſtones are offenſive, and preternatural to theſe Animals, as the ſtone is to man.</p>
                        <pb n="458" facs="tcp:37350:287"/>
                        <p>They are generated corticatery, from a ſmall rudiment of coag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentated ſand, which is by the appoſition of ſome new humour agglutinated, aſſimilated, and wrought into certain craſs plates like onyons, according to the magnitude of the duſt, and appoſition of the appellent humour.</p>
                        <p>This ſand or duſt in the centre of the ſtone, is of more efficacy then any other part of the ſtone; all whereof, whether internal or external, are ſmooth, polite, and ſplendent: which are not ſo in adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate ſtones, wherein there is no duſt or ſand.</p>
                        <p>The Perſians are the beſt of Bezaar-ſtones, next the oriental; but eſpecially thoſe that are taken out of Animals living in the Perſian Mountains; for thoſe that live in plains and valleys, feed not upon ſo ſalutary plants, as thoſe that inhabit excelſe plants: and therefore their ſtones are not ſo efficacious.</p>
                        <p>All of them are much commended againſt the bitings of vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate beaſts:
<note place="margin">Vires.</note> for their powder aſſumed or adhibited, cures wounds in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted by Scorpions, Vipers, or other Serpents; and inſperged on the ſame Animals, makes them torpid and innocuous. It is ſtory<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the King of <hi>Corduba</hi> was freed from a very pernicious poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, by the uſe of this ſtone; and therefore ſome think, Bezaar is rightly deduced from <hi>Bel</hi> in Hebrew, which ſignifies Lord; and <hi>Zaar,</hi> poyſon, calling it the Lord of Poyſons.</p>
                        <p>It conduces upon the ſame account to all venenate and contagious diſeaſes; as the Peſtilences, Morbils, ſmall-Pox, and the like: it cures alſo ſwoundings, long ſorrows, hyſterical paſſions, and many other malign affections; of which ſee <hi>N.

                        <p>MArgarites are taken out of certain Shell-fiſhes, living in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian ſea, very like Oyſters; which if they be ſmall, they keep the name Margarites; if greater, they are called Unions: for, they are found ſeverally, in ſeveral Shell-fiſhes: whence the Poet:

                        <p>Yet <hi>Aelianus</hi> contradicts this opinion; teaching from experience, that many Unions are generated and found in one Shell-fiſh, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the abundance of the fiſhes excrementitious matter, which is pure and lucid: they are not therefore called Unions, becauſe one onely is found in one Shell-fiſh, but becauſe two are never found conjoyned in the ſame. Thoſe that are white, round, ponderous,
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:37350:287"/>and ſmooth, ſuch as Queens weare about their necks, are beſt.</p>
                        <p>Many Shell-fiſhes generate Margarites; but the beſt are exoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, which are found in the Perſian Sea in the Eaſt: whence they are called Oriental Pearls; and in the tracts of <hi>Chyna,</hi> and many parts of <hi>India,</hi> where the Incoliſts call theſe Margaritiferous Shell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſhes, <hi>Berbert;</hi> and ſome Barbarians, <hi>Cheripe;</hi> others <hi>Chanquo;</hi> which is the Mother of Pearl.</p>
                        <p>This great Shell-fiſh is ſpiſs, moderately hollow like a comb, but not toothed on both ſides, but onely on one; not ſtriated without, but plain, and ſomething flave, ſmooth, ſplendent, and argenteous within: it is generated in its fleſh, as lumps in hogs fleſh, ſtones in the bladder, or other places: for I ſaw a man who avoided many ſtones by ſtool, each one whereof in magnitude equalized a Cheſnut or Acorn.</p>

                        <p>But to my purpoſe: theſe Shell-fiſhes expoſed to the air, or aſſayed with a knife, open, and the Margarites are found together with their fleſh; which indeed are neither bones, nor part of the piſcicle, but ſomething excrementitious, ſplendent, and concrete, like the ſhells wherewith they are tected, which are outwardly ſcabre and impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite, but within ſmooth and fair: ſo that the true Mother of Pearls, is never naturally, but alwayes artificially poliſhed.</p>
                        <p>Thoſe Margarites are greater, which are taken from the greater Conchae, and in the deeper ſea.</p>
                        <p>They are ſo much ſought after by women, that no one, though of mean fortune, thinks ſhe is ſufficiently adorned, till ſhe carry Pearls about her neck.</p>
                        <p>But their uſe is chiefly Medicinal; for all, both Ancients and latter writers, aver, That Margarites are very cordial, and exhilarate the heart: Alchymiſts diſſolve them, and get thence liquor of Pearls, whereof they predicate many, but ridiculous things.</p>
                        <p>I knew a very crafty Empyrical Chirurgeon in <hi>Paris,</hi> who requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſix Peices for the adhibition of two Swallows to his Patient;
<note place="margin">Vires.</note> and when all admired he ſhould ask ſo unreaſonably, <hi>I ſhould</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>have demanded much more, becauſe I fed theſe Animals a whole Month with the liquor of Pearls.</hi>

                        </head>
                        <p>THe Sea-Navel is either a whole piſcicle, whereof <hi>Rondeletius</hi> makes mention, or a part, bone or regument of ſome greater fiſh: the former is a turbinated and ſmall Shell-fiſh, ſo like a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel, that none that ſee it can chuſe but ſo name it.</p>
                        <p>The other Umbilike is all oſſeous, which is either a ſhell, or the bone of another fiſh; for many fiſhes have certain bones given them by Nature, either for the inſertion of their fins, whereby they defend their lives, or for the confirmation and motion of their bodies. Thus Sepia is founded upon its bone; thus the Slaits back is armed with many pricks, which by light cocture may be eaſily ſojoyned from its body: whoſe officles if you take away, their prickles do well repreſent the Sea-Navel.</p>
                        <p>We therefore ſuſpect, with <hi>Berv. Deſſennius,</hi> that Sea-Umbilikes are deſumed from Sea-Animals, and caſt on the ſhore with other ſtones; and yet they are not of the ſame kinde with ſtones. Some call them Sea-Gems; but their faculties are not ſo eximious, as that they ſhould be repoſed among Gems. Their form is well known, their colour is in ſome white, in ſome red: they are frequently ſold in <hi>France.</hi>

                        <p>THe Dental is a certain ſmall Shell-fiſh, oblong, white, ſharp without, very ſmooth within, hollow like a little tube, and acuminated on one ſide, like a Dogs tooth: whence it is called a Dental; for it is a ſhell like a tooth, wherein a vernicle is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>created; which is oblong, and ſlender, anſwerable to the cavity of the ſhell, which goes out of its domicil, ſometimes to draw water, and ſeek victuals. Both it and its tube, grow as a reſtaceous Cane upon a Rock, or an old ſhell: It is indued with the ſame ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue with the Seas Umbilike, and other teſtaceous piſcicles, and may as well ingrede the compoſition of the Citrian Unguent, as the former.</p>

                        <p>THere is another Sea Shell-fiſh, called an Antal, whoſe uſe in Medicine is very frequent, if we make the Citrian un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guent.</p>
                        <p>It is a teſtaceous tube bred in the Sea, of a little fingers length, ſtriated without, ſmooth and hollow within; out of whoſe cavity a ſmall piſcicle is educed.</p>
                        <p>This ſeems to be the fiſh which <hi>Athenaeus</hi> calls <hi>Solen;</hi> for that is of the kinde of long Shell-fiſhes, with a double ſhell, ſmooth, ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and hollow like a reed, and open at both ends. <hi>Pliny</hi> calls it a Dactyl, or a Digit, becauſe it equalizes a finger in longitude; or as ſome ſay, reſembles a mans nail. However, the Antal we uſe is very well known and vulgar; neither ſhould we loſe any precious Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicament, if it were abſent; for we can ſubſtitute in its ſtead a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſhell that is white and ſtriated, which ſtrangers bring from the Sea, near that famous Mount which is ſacred to St. <hi>Michael:</hi> for all of them are of an equal vertue, as to the confecture of the ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guent; whereunto alſo another accedes, not eaſily known by name; ſome call it <hi>Amentum;</hi> others <hi>Amiantus;</hi> for it is yet doubted, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Amentum</hi> be that ſtone <hi>Amiantus,</hi> which is of a whitiſh green, and by many called Sciſſile-Alome; from which it differs much.</p>
                        <p>For Sciſſile-Alome is manifeſtly aſtrictive; and being injected upon coals, burns; but plumeous Alome is acrimonious, ſafe from flame, and well termed <hi>Amiantus,</hi> or <hi>Amentum,</hi> or <hi>Amiantum,</hi> which the Citrian Unguent admits of: but I dare not aſſert this for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, ſeeing Amentum is a barbarous word well underſtood by none, as it appears by the opinions of ſuch Authors as have written of it: for <hi>Theophraſtus</hi> will have it the name of a tree; <hi>Matthaeus Sylvaticus,</hi> burnt glaſs; <hi>Manlius</hi> burnt lime; ſome Suet, or the fat of glaſs; others, Talkum, or the ſpecular glaſs, which is indeed very conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient for this Unguent; as alſo plumbeous Alome, which Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecaries by good reaſon uſe for Amentum, or Amiantus.</p>
                        <p>There is alſo much mention in ſhops, of Bizantian Blatta, which is a cover very like that wherewith the Purple-fiſh is tected; yet this ſimilitude is onely as to their ſubſtance and faculties, and not as to their forms: for the tegument of the Purple-worm is round, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Rondeletius;</hi> and this Blatta long and ſtrict, found in nardiferous lakes, and thence ſuaveolent; for theſe worms eat Spikenard, and this Blatta is called the odorate Nayl, for it ſmells ſomewhat like a Beaver.

                        <head>CHAP. 27. <hi>Of Tortoiſes.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p>TOrtoiſes are either aquatical, living in the Sea, or ſweet-watel; or amphibious, living partly on the land, and partly on the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: whence <hi>Pliny</hi> comprehending them all in a quaternal number, calls them either Marine, or Fluvial, Terreſtrial, or Paluſtrian.</p>
                        <p>A Tortoiſe is a candated Animal, with four feet, ſquamous, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful to the ſight, whoſe ſhell is of an oval form, long, broad, hollow within, and without extuberant like a Buckler, under which it ſometimes hides its head, tail, feet, and all; and ſometimes it puts them out even at pleaſure.</p>
                        <p>This alone of ſquamous Animals, according to <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> hath Reins, and a Bladder: it layes Egges with hard ſhells of two co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, which it reconds in a Ditch, excavated like a hogſhead, and covers them with the earth; which it makes even, and ſo ſits upon it, till its young ones be excluded.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Solinus</hi> ſaith, That in the Indian Sea there are Tortoiſes of ſo great a magnitude, that their ſhells, open at the bottom, and joyned at the top, make ſo large houſes for the vulgar Indians, that a nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous family may dwell therein. Yea, ſome uſe them in ſtead of Boats, wherein they ſayl from one Iſle to another in the Red-Sea.</p>
                        <p>With the Troglodites they are cornigerous, but leſs then the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian.</p>
                        <p>Tortoiſes are of much uſe,
<note place="margin">Vires.</note> both in Cibaries and Medicine; for their decoction helps ſuch as are conſumed and attenuated: and therefore they uſefully ingrede the confecture of the reſumptive Syrupe. Many delight in their fleſh, but it is ſuch a deformed Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal, in head, tail, feet, form, colour, and ſpots, reſembling the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine kinde, that nature ſeems to note it as offenſive and unwhole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome: which they alſo confeſs who love it; but that its dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and condiments make it leſs noxious, for elſe it were hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid.</p>

                        <p>MYropoliſts uſe whole Frogs, in the compoſition of <hi>Vigonius</hi> his ſalve, which the Author deſcribed for the cure of a diſeaſe proper to his own Nation. <hi>Sylvius</hi> alſo ſaith, Their decoction will eaſe the Tooth-ache, if the mouth be waſhed therewith: their aſhes, with Pitch, according to <hi>Dioſcorides,</hi> or rather with Honey, according to <hi>Pliny,</hi> will bring again fallen hairs. The Emplaiſters wherewith they are mixed, are thence ſiccative, and diſcuſſive,
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:37350:289"/>eſpecially in the dolours of the junctures: They are Antidotal a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Serpentine poyſons, according to <hi>Dioſcorides,</hi> if they be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocted, eaten with Salt and Oyl, and their broth ſupped.</p>
                        <p>But all Frogs are not edible; whereof there are many varieties: for ſome delight ſolely in water, and live there ordinarily; others on the dry ſoyl: others alſo are amphibious, living equally on the water and earth.</p>
                        <p>Some of the watery Frogs live in Fenny and muddy places, and are pernicious, acceding near the nature of Toads; others live in limpid and fountain water, and are wholeſome, and repoſed among Cibaries.</p>
                        <p>Some of thoſe that feed on dry ſoyls, live amongſt reeds, others amongſt bryars and thorns: the former, which are leaſt of all, are called <hi>Calamitae,</hi> and the latter <hi>Rubetae,</hi> by the Latines; by the Greeks, <hi>Phrynoi;</hi> which are as pernicious as the Paluſtrian Frogs: thoſe they call Dryophites, which climb up Oaks, and live in or about them; and the Diopetes, which fall with ſtorms and warm ſhowers out of the air, are no better then the reſt.</p>
                        <p>All of them are mute in winter, except the watery Frogs; which at the end of Winter, and beginning of the Spring, begin to croak, to wit, when Tadpoles are procreated in putrid waters, which ſome falſly call Frogs-ſperm, or Frogs-egges. <hi>Ariſt.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Hence many have derided the Medicament of a certain Alchy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt, who preſcribes the water of Frogs-ſperm, to the Pimples and ſwellings of the face, eyes, and the whole body; whereas he might hunt, exenterate, diſſect, exhauſt, and ſearch the ſeminals of all the Frogs in <hi>France,</hi> and never get ſo much ſperm as would wet the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of his Metal-pan.</p>
                        <p>Experience alſo ſhews, and learned <hi>Rondeletius</hi> hath averred, That Tadpoles come of Mud, and turn not into Frogs. All Frogs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the watery ones, are pernicious and malign; as alſo, thoſe of them alſo that are maculated with black ſpots, like Toads, of whoſe nature they participate: and thoſe that uſe them for meat, are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with a plumbeous colour. Wherefore they ſhould not be taken ſave for Phyſick, for they putrifie the body.</p>
                        <p>Yet ſome put Paluſtrian Frogs, others <hi>Rubetae,</hi> to the confection of <hi>Jo. de Vigo</hi> his ſalve: but I think amphibious Frogs are better.</p>
                        <p>For the <hi>Rubetae,</hi> which live among bryars, thorns, and dry ſoyls, being venenate and acrimonious, impart a certain quality to the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicament, whereby it vellicates the skin, and raiſes lumps; and the water are not ſo efficacious: therefore thoſe that live partly in water, and partly on the land, muſt be elected as beſt.</p>

                        <p>A Viper is ordinarily of a cubits length, and often longer; of a ſubflave colour, maculated with many round ſpots: the male is by
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:37350:290"/>the Greeks called <hi>Echis;</hi> its head is anguſt and acute; its neck craſſer, and body ſlenderer then the Female; its tail, like that of other Serpents, grows more gracile by degrees, and not on a ſudden, as that of the Female: it hath ſharper ſcales at the end of its tail; which when moved, it erects, juſt as an angry Cock doth his Plumes in fighting.</p>
                        <p>He hath two Canine teeth; the Female more, according to that of the Poet:
<q>
                              <l>Huic gemini apparent dentes in carne, venenum</l>
                              <l>Fundentes, verubus ſed Foemina pluribus atrox.</l>

                        <p>He alſo hath a paſſage in his tail, neerer his belly then that of the Females: he goes alſo more ſtoutly.</p>
                        <p>The Female Vipers are of a yellowiſh colour, with an elated neck, reddiſh eyes, and lucent; of an inverecund and fierce aſpect; their heads are broad, their tails ſhort, macilent, ſquamous, and all a like gracile, not gradually ſo; their paſſages neerer their tails; their bellies more prominent, and their pace flower.</p>
                        <p>The Latines call it <hi>Vipera,</hi> becauſe <hi>Vi parit,</hi> that is, it is forced to bring forth; or elſe becauſe <hi>Vivum parit,</hi> that is, it brings forth li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving young, contrary to the mode of other Serpents, which firſt lay eggs: and the Viper indeed procreates eggs, like them of fiſhes; but every egge hath a young living Viper involved onely in a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane.</p>
                        <p>Yet it ſometimes happens, that the laſt ſeeking egreſs before the firſt, and impatient of longer delay, erodes his Parents belly and ſides, and ſo it is produced a Matricide: but that as ſeldom happens, as, when the Male thruſts his head into the Females mouth in copu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, the Female, ſatiated with the ſweetneſs of the pleaſure, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truncabes the Male: which I think is never.</p>
                        <p>When other Serpents in winter run into caverns, Vipers onely abſoond themſelves under ſtones, and depoſe their old age, like other Reptiles.</p>
                        <p>Vipers are preferred before all other Serpents, in the confection of this Theriack, becauſe when compounded of others, its vertue is more tabifical. (<hi>Gal: Cap.</hi> 10. <hi>Lib. de Theriaca.</hi>)</p>
                        <p>The Heads and tails, which contain the moſt virulent poyſon, muſt be abſcinded: for the Viper hath the moſt pernicious head of all venenate beaſts. <hi>Dioſcorides</hi> holds it ridiculous, that any ſet certain meaſure of the Head and tail ſhould be preſcinded.</p>

                        <p>There are both in <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> very idoneous Vipers for this ſolemn confection, as in the Pictavian fields, whence many are brought to <hi>Paris;</hi> of whoſe fleſh we make Paſtils, and uſe their fat in <hi>Vigo</hi> his emplaſter; whoſe extraction and preparation is eaſie: The fat muſt firſt be taken, with its skins, and waſhed in clear cold water, till it be ſincere; then may the membranes be ſeparated;
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:37350:291"/>then muſt the fat be melted in a double veſſel, and continually agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with a wooden ſtick; when it is melted, it muſt be percolated into cold water, which may be abjected, and the fat kept, and repoſed in a convenient veſſel: ſome waſh it again, that it may depoſe all its poyſon.</p>
                        <p>I can ſcarce aſſent to their opinion, who believe, that ſuch live long as eat Vipers fleſh; for it procreates very ill ſucce, and digeſts and ſiccates vehemently: ſo that they who eat it are grievouſly cruciated with thirſt, and thence cognominated Dipſades. <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith, that ſome are of opinion, that ſuch as are bitten by Vipers, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be cured by drinking, but will burſt ere they can quench their thirſt.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Galen</hi> proves by many Hiſtories, that Vipers conduce to the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prous: There was (ſaith he) a Leper in <hi>Aſia,</hi> who was foetid to look on, and graveolent; who at firſt was converſant, and did eat with his companions, till ſome of his company began to be inquinated, and he of ſuch a horrid and deteſtable a form, as none could indure to look on him; then they bound him in a Cottage neer the river, and gave him daily aliment. The next Summer, about the riſing of the Dog-ſtar, when a ſervant brought fragrant wine to the reap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and ſet the pot by the river-ſide, when they came to drink, the Boy poured out the wine into a cup, and with the wine a dead Viper; the reapers being therewithal afrighted, quenched their thirſt with water, and ſent the wine to the Leper, pitying his condition, and judging it better for him to die therewith, then to live in that miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: but he, drinking thereof, was unexpectedly cured, his skin fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off like a ſhell from a locuſt.</p>
                        <p>And another event, not much unlike this, happened in <hi>Myſia,</hi> not far from our City: There was a rich man, but Leprous, who was in love with his maid that was beautiful; but ſhe hating ſo deſcorm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a man, clandeſtinely kept other lovers company: the diſeaſed, in hopes of recovery, betook himſelf to ſome Fountains of hot water, wherewith the vicine parts abounded, which were ſqualid and full of Vipers; one whereof crept into his wine pot: the wench per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving that a Viper was there ſuffocated, was glad ſhe had ſuch an opportunity put into her hands; ſhe then gives a cup of it to her Maſter, who drinking of it, was perfectly cured, as the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Galen</hi> recenſeates more ſtories, whereby he proves, that Vipers cure the Leproſie. We have ſhewed in our Antidotary, how it muſt be prepared, before it ingrede the confection of the The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riack.</p>

                        <p>It is a ſmall four-footed Animal, tected with ſmall, frequent, and ſubluteous ſcales, with a long head, little thicker then its neck, a high belly, a round tayl like a Lizard, but ſhorter, and crooked to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the end, with a grey line from its head, to the end of its tayl.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Dioſcorides</hi> ſaith, It is the product either of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> or <hi>India,</hi> or of the Red-ſea, though it is ſeen in <hi>Lydia</hi> of <hi>Mauritania:</hi> Some do erroneouſly take it for the Salamander. <hi>Pliny</hi> calls it the Land-Cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>codile, for it very much reſembles the Crocodile of <hi>Nilus.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But there is no proportion in their dimenſions; for this is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes ſmall, ſcarce exceeding a cubit in length: whereas the Cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>codile of <hi>Nilus</hi> attains two and twenty cubits, and yet no term of his concretion, though his original is from an Egge no bigger then a Gooſes Egge: He lives both upon the land and water; his eyes are like Swines eyes: his ſight in the water is dull; but out, very quick.</p>
                        <p>This Animal alone, except the Parrer, moves his upper jaw; he hath a ſmall rongue adhering to his under-jaw; his legs come out of his ſide; his feet are ſmall, in reference to his body; his claws ſtrong; his skin ſquamous, cruſtaceous, and impenetrable, ſave un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his belly, which is ſoft. This Animal lives ſixty years, layes ſixty Egges in ſixty dayes, ſits upon its Egges ſixty dayes, before young ones be excluded; it hath ſixty joynts in its backbone; and as many teeth in its head, as it will lye dayes in winter in ſome Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern without meat. The more curious Scrutator may have a fuller deſcription of the Crocodile, in <hi>Ariſtotle, Pliny,</hi> and later Writers, who have luſtrated <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and the Oriental Coaſts.</p>

                        <p>THey make an Oyl of dead Scorpions, infuſed in Oyl, which they cognominate from the ſame, for many uſes in Medicine: for, by way of liniment, it breaks and expels the ſtones in the Reins and Bladder, and moves Urine: it cures the bitings of Vipers, Serpents, and other venenate Beaſts: if it be adhibited to the arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holes and groins in time of Peſtilence, it will either preſerve the uſer from it, or cure him of it: it will alſo cure a wound inflicted
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:37350:292"/>by a Scorpion; and ſo will its own body, bruiſed and applied.</p>
                        <p>A Scorpion is a terreſtrial Animal, with a long and nodous tayl, whoſe end is armed with a long and oblique ſting, perviated with a ſmall hole, through which it effunds its poyſon into the part prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: it hath arms and fore-cleyes biſulcated; its tayl is alwayes ready for a ſtroke; it never lets ſlip an opportunity: it ſtrikes obliquely.</p>
                        <p>The Maſculine Scorpion is maculated on the belly, and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleys; and its poyſon is more pernicious, the Females more milde; though ſome write contrary.</p>
                        <p>There are eight kindes of Scorpions: the firſt is white, which they ſay is not lethiferous; the ſecond yellowiſh, whoſe ſtroke is ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded with vehement ardour, and an inextinguiſhable thirſt; the third is blackiſh, whoſe ſtroke depraves the members of motion, and makes men mad, cauſing fooliſh laughter; the fourth is ſomewhat green, it hath ſeven knots in his tayl; perpetual and great cold, though in the heat of Summer, follows upon its ſtroke; the fifth is pale and livid, and infects the percuſſed with tumours in his groins; the ſixth is like a little Sea Crab-fiſh; the ſeventh hath greater Cleys, and is very like the Crab we call <hi>Pagurus;</hi> the eighth is of a Honey-colour, it hath wings like a Locuſt, and the laſt knot of its tayl is black.</p>
                        <p>Winged Scorpions are very rare with us, but frequent and great in <hi>India</hi> and <hi>Aphrica,</hi> with ſeven knots in their tayls.</p>
                        <p>If we reckon the variety of Scorpions, by the variety of their colours, ſome are called flave Scorpions, ſome yellow, ſome ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neritious, ſome green, ſome ferrugineous, ſome vinous, ſome white, and others fuliginous.</p>
                        <p>The ſmitings of Scorpions are farre more perillous to women, then men; and eſpecially to Virgins: for they are alwayes lethal to ſuch, unleſs they be preſently helped: and ſuch Scorpions as have ſeven knots in their tayls, are judged moſt cruel.</p>
                        <p>They procreate and ſit upon Vernicles like Egges,
<note place="margin">Vires.</note> and they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a progeny, which coming to perfection, drives them away; and thus Scorpions are ſaid to be killed by their young ones. But theſe things reſpect not Pharmacy, and therefore not for my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>

                        </head>
                        <p>MAny ſmall Animals are generated of Worms, and Worms of many great Animals: yea, this progeny ſprings from all altered and putrid matter, ſtones, bones, wood, fruit, cheeſe, fleſh; and all things ſeem at firſt to turn into worms: for mans own fleſh is abſumed by worms, and his clothes by moths: And though cold things much reſiſt putretude, yet worms are generated in the coldeſt
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:37350:292"/>ſnow; and ſome are procreated of ſalt: they are alſo generated in Animals daily, their body abounding with putrid humours; for there worms are generated, where putretude reſides: for, Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is their Mother. I ſaw a worm of a palms length, come out with the blood of the vein of ones arm opened: They are ſtill ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated in the inteſtines, and other parts of mans body, and alſo in Harts heads.</p>
                        <p>Every Inſect generates a worm, except the Butterfly, which is procreated of another diſſimilar Inſect: as the Poet;
<q>Et fio volucris, qui modo vermis eram.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>The family of Worms being thus ample, I ſhall onely ſpeak of Earth-worms, which are uſed in Medicine: for theſe waſhed in white-wine, prepared, macerated in Oyl, and duly elixated in a double veſſel, afford us an Oyl, very conducible in nervous affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>
                        <p>They are alſo aſſumed at the mouth, after due preparation, to wit, when they are waſhed, dryed, levigated, and mixed with other Powders, to cure Virgins pale colours.</p>
                        <p>Many call them the Earths Inteſtines; others, Earth-worms; others, Earth-lumbricks: they have a long round body, with nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bone, eye, nor ear: They go ſo, that the precedent part draws the conſequent in their locomotion.</p>
                        <p>They are procreated of the mud of the earth, and animated by the ſame cauſe that other Inſects are. They are deſtitute of eyes, ears, feet, members, and are like oblong fibres, whoſe parts are not diſcriminated, ſave by ſome knots and denervations a little beyond their middles.</p>
                        <p>Spring or Winter-ſhowers, if not glacial, elicite them: they are neither liberally, nor copiouſly generated in the earth, much trod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den upon, but frequently in fat and waſte ground:

                        <p>THeſe Flyes have onely a nominal affinity with Beetles, for they are often uſed in Medicine, Beetles never. <hi>Galen</hi> hath experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced them good againſt ſcabs and Leproſies; and Phyſicians finde them to provoke Urine.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> calls them Putrid Animals, becauſe they are produced of putrid matter: They are procreated, nouriſhed, and found in many ſhrubs, as the Bramble; and in many tall trees, as the Aſh: ſhoſe that are found in Corn, are verſicolorate, and have tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe lines in their wings, with an oblong body, and are very good.</p>
                        <pb n="470" facs="tcp:37350:293"/>
                        <p>But they will be more fit for uſe, if they be injected into an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then veſſel, whoſe orifice is covered with a rare linen cloth, and turned downwards, that by the halite of ſharp vinegar, they may be exanimated, then dryed, repoſed in wooden boxes, glaſs or earthen veſſels, and kept for the ſpace of two years.</p>
                        <p>They are mixed but in ſmall quantity, to Medicaments that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke Urine, by <hi>Galens</hi> adviſe, who would have them injected whole; but the later Writers would have their legs and wings abſcinded and abjected. When a Noble Matron of <hi>Paris</hi> was holden with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Feaver, accompanied with the heat of the Reins, and other grievous ſymptomes, and had committed the care of her cure to Mr. <hi>Martin,</hi> a learned and perite <hi>Pariſian</hi> Medick; by the perſwaſion of ſome, ſhe call'd one <hi>Rivierius,</hi> a courtly Medick, who feeling her pulſe, ſaid, If ſhe had called him a little ſooner, he would have applyed a dragm of French flies to the region moſt affected, and have preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſtored her to ſanity: ſo he left the Matron grieved, and her ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Medick aſtoniſhed at his humour, manners, words, and actions; who was ſo far from adhibiting ſuch a company of theſe flies, that he applyed not one, and yet reſtored her to health: for this flie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moſt dry and light, it is credible, one weighing not above a grain; what were it leſs then carnifice to adhibite ſixty of them, which weigh but a dragm, to the aeſture of the Reins? But take this obiter, not becauſe I am incenſed againſt the man, but that I might ſhew, that theſe flies are very noxious to the Bladder, Reins, and other parts, by inducing inflammations; yet very good mixed with other Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments in a ſmall quantity.</p>

                        </head>
                        <p>THat glory is now given to Silk, which was given to fine linen, wherewith the Ancient Kings were inveſted: and as we read in <hi>Luke</hi> 10. <hi>A certain rich man arrayed.</hi> This flax was a kinde of te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuious line, next in dignity to <hi>Asbeſtinum,</hi> whereof moſt ſubtile veſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were made, with which women were moſt delighted; which, according to <hi>Pliny,</hi> grew neer <hi>Elis</hi> in <hi>Achaia;</hi> according to <hi>Pollux,</hi> in <hi>India,</hi> and <hi>Aegypt;</hi> and <hi>Pauſanias,</hi> in <hi>Greece,</hi> on a tree not unlike our Poplar, with willowiſh leaves: but whether its plant be a tree or an herb, it is altogether unknown to us. It bears not onely leaves, but line alſo, which the People of <hi>Seres, Scytia,</hi> and <hi>Aſiatica,</hi> perite in ſpining, draw out into ſmall threads, and make it into veſtments for rich men; and that which the Serians work, is called Silk. <hi>Asbeſtus</hi> is either a certain ſtone of a ferreous colour, in the Mountains of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cadia,</hi> which being once accended, can never be extinguiſhed; or elſe flax, whereof Napkins are made, that will take flame, and not burn away; like plumbeous Lead.</p>
                        <p>But we have no ſuch by ſſigerous plant, nor veſtments made of their Down; but onely <hi>Bombycina,</hi> which, as <hi>Byſsina</hi> of old, is now called Silk; which is as good for dignity in the ſame uſes, and beſides accommodated to Medicinal exhibitions: for Apothecaries, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the Arabians dictate, have an opinion of Silk,
<note place="margin">Vires.</note> that it will purge blood, roborate the vital faculties, recreate the heart, il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrate the ſpirits, refreſh all faculties, and help all the ſpirits. Theſe are the eximious <hi>Encomia,</hi> wherewith the Barbarians nobilitate the excrement of their virulent Inſect. But ſeeing any one may Philoſophize, and propoſe his opinion in the matter in hand, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, I think Silk is of ſmall uſe in Medicine: for it is the dry, inodorate, exuicous recrement of an imperfect Animal, affine to Cob-webs, but inept and ineffectual in mans cure.</p>
                        <p>It may be, that that <hi>Byſsinum,</hi> which the latter writers call fine flax, is indued with eximious faculties; but no ſuch being now fonnd, nor brought to us, our Pharmacopoliſts cannot ſpeak of it, unleſs they ſpeak in their dreams. And I wonder, upon what reaſon they give crude Silk to the ſick: when it is tincted with Scarlet, it is indeed vertuous, but it borrows that faculty from its infection; and therefore I had rather preſcribe the dying grains alone, then fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraneouſly ſpend their ſucce in dying Silk. But let perite Medicks, who have onely reaſon for their Law, be Judges in the caſe.</p>
                        <p>Theſe Silk-worms are little Animals, excluded from ſmall, round, and blackiſh ſeeds, called by ſome egges, cheriſhed with a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate calour; animated, and at firſt formed into Minute-worms, which educated on the leaves and boughs of the Mulberry-tree, after
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:37350:294"/>a while ſpin their ſlender webs, or Silken threads, whereof precious cloth is abundantly woven.</p>
                        <p>When they are more adult, they make of themſelves hoods and domicils for themſelves; and there in a ſhort time, they tranſmute themſelves into white Butterflies, which produce ſeeds, or ſmall eggs, whereof other worms of the ſame kinde are generated. But theſe being known to Women and Children, need no further deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption.</p>
                        <p>Some Medicks uſe the Galls of many Animals; the Liver and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtines of Wolves, the brains of Sparrows, the teſticles of Cocks, and Aſells which are found under water-veſſels: but theſe not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greding the compoſitions in our Shop, belong not to us. Thus I have in three Books, by Gods auxiliation, briefly and clearly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed all Medicinal matter: to whom be Honour, Glory and Praiſe now and Ever.</p>

                  <head>THE PREFACE TO THE READER.</head>
                  <p>ALL things in general, which the whole Maſſe of the Earth doth expoſe to ſight and view, or include within her bowels, the greateſt portion thereof doth either ſerve man for Medicament or Aliment; which indeed ought not at all times to be gathered, whileſt the neceſsity of man calls for them; or the bowels of the Earth robbed thereof in vain, till the Phyſician appoint them for the Relief of Mans body, which is the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject for the which they were created: Except it be ſuch Exoticks, which up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all occaſions in Pharmacopolies ought to be kept, both for preſent and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture uſe. Concerning which, <hi>Pliny, cap. 1. lib. 28. Hippoc. Epiſt. ad Abdent. Herophil.</hi> hath treated of at large.</p>
                  <p>For whereas Medicine is the gift of God, and Medicament the hand of God, it muſt needs follow then, that an Apothecary, of all Profeſsions, muſt needs be the moſt excellent, though not always (it may be) in the greatneſs of eſtate, yet in the Bayes of Honour. What is his Shop, but a Magazine of the Globes Treaſure, a Store-houſe of Natures <hi>Arcana's?</hi> whatſoever is comprehended under the Cope of Heaven, there in the Maſs is contained. What can the main Sea produce, or the depth of the great Abyſs? What can the four Elements diſcover, that is not of uſe in our Shops? Alas, is not the Body of Man the receptacle of innumerable Diſeaſes? elſe, whither tend theſe Myriads of Remedies? What Diſeaſe can be found <hi>in rerum natura,</hi> that hath not either an Antidote to defend, or a Corroſive to deſtroy? What can now be objected, or produced as an <hi>Aenigma</hi> to the Phyſician? Are not thoſe great Giants, which were veiled in obſcurity to the Ancients, now laid level? Who is there that profeſſes himſelf the Son of <hi>Aeſculapius,</hi> that knows not now how to encounter a <hi>Solutio Continui, Phlegmon, Ptery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gium, Polypus, Hepatitis, Lienteria, Enterocle, Aedema, Schyrrhus, Podagra,</hi> with many others, which formerly puzled ſo many Grandees in knowledge? What place now, wherein there is not <hi>a Sanctuary for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy to fly unto,</hi> where a <hi>ſalubrious Medicine for every Malady is publickly to be had?</hi> What a gallant ſpectacle is it, to behold an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecaries
<pb facs="tcp:37350:297"/>thecaries Shop well ſtored of all things neceſſary, Inſtruments for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring of Medicines, and Veſſels to repoſe the ſame in, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But alas! how is this Art now abuſed! what a company of illiterate <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noramus's</hi> have intruded themſelves therein, whoſe knowledge is exerciſed in nothing elſe, but in ſetting mens lives at ſale; who out of ſecular ends, to inhance the Traffick into their hand, by felling cheap, have, and do to this day, (and I am ſorry that I have no other Tenſe to ſpeak in) huddle up a Medicine after any manner, taking one thing for another; inſomuch that the Medicament neither can effect what might be expected otherwiſe from it, nor doth it the Patient any good, but rather operate contrary to the Phyſicians expectations? Theſe are the Vipers that poyſon and infect a Commonwealth, the diſgrace of the Profeſsion, and the ruine of Mankinde. I dare avouch, and ſhall maintain, that more are killed by the ill-compounded, ſuccidaneous Medicaments of many Apothecaries here in this City, then by the malignity of any diſtemper whatſoever. And hence it is, that the Phyſician comes to be undervalued, our Profeſsion deſpiſed and the whole Commonwealth abuſed; and if a ſpeedy Remedy be not taken for theſe abominable Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes, what will follow? Are theſe men fit for the ſociety of Chriſtians? or are they to be allowed, to act in a buſineſs of ſuch concernment, where a mans Life runs the hazard of Ruine? It is the ſhame of <hi>London,</hi> that amongst ſo many learned and able Artiſts, thoſe Piperly-Dizzards ſhould not be found out and detected.</p>
                  <p>But we ſhall detain the Reader no longer in the Porch, but open the Shop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doors, for every one to enter in; where Knowledge ſhall be ſold at a cheap rate: Onely take notice, That there is intended for the Preſs, a Treatiſe diſcovering the true and infallible Marks of every Medicine, whereby it may be quickly diſcerned, whether it be rightly compounded or no: Together with the loweſt Price thereof. With many other things, which, God willing, ſhall be made publick, for the information of the Ignorant.</p>

                        </head>
                        <p>
                           <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>T the beginning and non-age of the world, Men uſed fruits for bread, and water for wine; and it is probable, both Horſes and Beaſts had the ſame aliment, <hi>(Hip. lib. de vet. Med.)</hi> but when the fruits which grew ſpontaneouſly, would not ſuffice for their nutrition and ſanity, our fore-fathers made a bread, or rather a pulteſs, of Wheat macera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, ſhelled, and bruiſed; whereupon the Romans lived a long time, after <hi>Auſonius.</hi> But their ſtomacks nauſeating to be alwayes ſerved with the ſame meat, and they not content with bread alone, begun at length to taſte of Birds, and then to hunt after beaſts and fiſhes. Their deſires thus breaking out by little and little, invented culture, and a Thouſand gulous provocations: whereas <hi>Auſonius</hi> ſaith, that before that time, the Acorn was mans and beaſts common meat, and a trees ſhade their common houſe.</p>
                        <p>For in that firſt age, caves were their houſes, the tectures of wood their cottages, rocks and ſaxous places their Cities: and a long time after, the Dardanians made them ſordid houſes in mud, the Balearians in hollowed rocks; as many Indians at this day in Oyſters and Tortoiſes ſhells; and others weave themſelves houſes of reeds and fenny herbs, (<hi>Alex. ab Alex. C.</hi> 24. <hi>Li.</hi> 5.)</p>
                        <p>But as mens manners are now more polite, their diſhes more dainty; ſo are their houſes more artificially ſtructed: ſome build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves edifices in the middle of ſome river; others on the top of a hill; others at the Sea ſide; as each mans fancy leads him.</p>
                        <p>But an Apothecaries houſe, ſhould be built in none of theſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; but rather in a City, then in a Town; in an apprique and lucid place, rather then in an opaque and umbrous; and in a nited ſtreet, rather then in one inquinated with filth and putretude.</p>
                        <p>It muſt be ample, and high, that ſuch ſimples as ſhould be kept drie, may be repoſed in its higheſt room; and ſuch as ſhould be moiſt, in its cellar.</p>
                        <p>There ſhould be many, at leaſt one cubicle betwixt theſe two, to which the Apothecary may betake himſelf; under which he muſt have an ample, quadrate, and lucid Shop: yet neither ſo much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the Sun, as it may califie, melt, or too much drie his Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caments; nor ſo much to the wind, as to moleſt them.</p>
                        <p>In it there ſhould be two doors; the one an outward door towards the ſtreet, the other poſtical or inward, into his kitchin, or inner chamber; wherein he may not only eat his victuals, but prudently ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve through ſome lattice-window, what is done in the Shop, what given, and what received; and ſo mind his Apprentices, whether
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:37350:298"/>they ſpend their time idlely, faithfully and accurately execute their office, or do all for his good, and effect his work.</p>
                        <p>In the other angle of the kitchin, near the Chimney, muſt be an Aeſtuary or Hypocauſte, wherein he may repoſe his Sugar-junkets and ſolid confections more ſafely: and if the place be large enough, there may in the next place be made a Tabern, wherein he may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond many ſeeds, fruits, and other ſimples, which he buyes in great quantity; as Prunes, Almonds, Honey, Seeds, Roots, and much of Woods.</p>
                        <p>In his Shop he muſt repoſe onely compounds, and ſuch ſimples as are either rare and precious, or are of diuturnal and frequent uſe; as Tamarinds, Raiſins, Liquorice, Polypody, Senny, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And that his Medicaments may be duely diſpoſed in his Pharma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copoly, many ſhelves muſt be claſſically collocated therein, from the bottome upwards, upon wooden and iron nails faſtened in the walls, and the partition betwixt the kitchin and the Shop, ſo that ſome of their rowes may include leſſer, ſome greater boxes; ſome, Earthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pots; ſome, Glaſſes; ſome, Tinne-veſſels; and ſome, Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſſels: ſo diligently and diſcreetly collocated, that thoſe that are of more frequent uſe, may not be in the ſame row with thoſe that are more rarely exhibited; but that the one ſort may be neerer at hand, and the other remote.</p>
                        <p>The names alſo of the Medicaments, muſt be inſcribed upon every veſſel, and bag, wherein they are included; that the Medicament to be exhibited, may ſoon be ſeen, and not miſtaken for another.</p>

                        <p>THe Shops ſupellectuals, all which are either uſeful, or neceſſary, are almoſt innumerable: Thoſe are uſeful, but more profitable, which are more expetible for their ornament, and greater ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, then their inſervience; as many Silver veſſels, which take much with the vulgar; and the Apothecaries may by this external ſhew, acquire that glory, which by their learning and skill they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reach; and they are blamed by <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> who think this curious ſtuffe either odious or illiberal.</p>
                        <p>That ſame ſupellex is neceſſary, which ſerves either to repoſe Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments in, as many: Earthen, Glaſſy, Argenteous, Stanneous, Plumbeous, Cupreous, and Braſen-veſſels; for Syrupes, Sapes, Eclegms, Electuaries, Powders, Oyles, Salves, and Unguents: of which hereafter: or to prepare them; as, Marbles, Morters, Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtels, of Wood, Stone, and Metals; Rudicles, Pots, Kettles, Baſons, Diſhes, Pottengers, Frying-pans, Frixories, Poliſhers, Files, Sieves, Stainers, Preſſes, Gauntlers, Weights, Tongs, Knives, Marble ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, manifold Alembicks, Refrigerative Chanels, called Scrpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:37350:298"/>Lakes, in Fundibles, and many more, which it may be the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecary will not uſe once in a year.</p>
                        <p>Chymiſts have yet beſides theſe, ſome peculiar ſupellectils, which a witty fellow calls, The Inſtruments of Fallacy, and not of Pharma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: but this I would ſpeak of their abuſe, and not of their uſe.</p>
                        <p>The appellation and form of many Pharmaceutrical inſtruments, are ſooner known then their ſpecial uſes; for every one knows Saws, Files, Hammers and Knives; but the Apothecaries uſe for theſe, is to ſcrape Boars-teeth, Ivory, Guaiacum; to attenuate them into duſt, and levigate all ſuch things, as cannot by attrition be pulve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated: but other artificers uſe them in the works of their Arts; as the Goldſmith, in making Rings, Bracelets, and veſſels of Gold or Silver; the Blackſmith in making Nails; and all uſe Hammers, Anvils, and Tongs, to their peculiar works.</p>
                        <p>The Knives neceſſary for Pharmacopolies, muſt not be of one ſort onely, but ſome greater then others, ſome oblong, others ſhort, and others otherwiſe formed. The long and mucronated Knives, are much in uſe to ſcrape and purge roots; to divide and cleave the minute-boughs of wood, and caulicles of herbs: the ſhorter, which are not acuminated, but obtuſe, whoſe backs are very craſs, ſerve to cut Sugar into lumps; ſome whereof are very ſhort, but broad, of a Lunar ſhape, like thoſe wherewith Shoemakers cut their hides; wherewith ſome oleaginous ſeeds, and condited barks, which cannot be pulverated by a Peſtel, may be cut ſmall.</p>
                        <p>They ſerve alſo to divide Liquorice into ſmall pieces, that it may ingrede the confection of common junkets.</p>
                        <p>There is alſo another Knife longer then the reſt, whoſe point is reflected like a hook, which faſtened upon another hook ſet in the table, will with much eaſe divide Wood and Roots, while its haft is preſſed.</p>
                        <p>Yet all theſe varieties of Knives are not abſolutely neceſſary in each Shop; for the ſame Knife which in the Kitchin cuts bread, may in the Shop divide Wax, and ſcrape Roots.</p>

                        </head>
                        <p>NO one Inſtrument is either ſo neceſſary, or ſo frequently uſed in a Pharmacopoly, as a Morter: for nothing almoſt can either be made up, or brought to that paſs, without the help of the Morter. For ſeeing all Medicinal materials are ordinarily rude, and indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted, and nothing almoſt exhibited, as it comes out of the boſome of our Grandmother Nature; moſt things muſt by triture be divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, agitated, levigated, and ſubacted into compoſition, in a Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                        <p>And ſeeing that matter is multifarious, and requires various pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations, not onely from the induſtry of the Apothecary, but the
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:37350:299"/>adjument of the Inſtruments; wherein it acquires not onely a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient form, and a due magnitude, but a fit matter, from which the Medicament may mutuate ſomething: and therefore Piles or Morters are made of various Materials; as of Marble, Achates, Alabaſter, or other ſtone; and of Tinne, Lead, Iron, Braſs, Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; as alſo of Glaſs, and Ivory; and of Silver and Gold, more for oſtentation, then pure neceſſity.</p>
                        <p>One of Lead, or Glaſs, or Stone, is enough; but many of Braſs, one whereof muſt be very ample, for ſuch things as are hard or large; another ſmall, for Musk, Amber, Civet, Bezaar-ſtone, and ſuch Aromaticks.</p>
                        <p>Betwixt both, many of ſeveral magnitudes; ſome whereof may ſerve for Potions, others for Glyſters or Electuaries.</p>
                        <p>They muſt have as many Peſtels as Morters, made alſo of the like matter; for a plumbeous Peſtel beſt fits a plumbeous Morter; a braſen one, a braſen Morter; but an Iron Peſtel fits all Metals, and a wooden Peſtel all ſtony Morters, and all ſuch as new herbs are brayed in. When dry things muſt be pulverated, the Morter muſt be covered with Paper or Leather, leſt the ſmall Powder fly out and periſh, or trouble the brayers noſe and eyes.</p>
                        <p>Marble tables and Purple ſtones are alſo requiſite for the ſmaller levigation of ſome things; as Margarites and Precious ſtones, which may be levigated very ſmall, with a little Roſe-water, or other li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, for the Medicks ſcope.</p>

                        <p>SPatulaes and Spoons, are as it were the Apothecaries ſecond hands, wherewith he agitates Medicaments, while they are tunded in Morters, or cocted in Diſhes, that the pulveration and coction of each part may be equal; and with theſe he records the Medicaments in idoneous veſſels, and with theſe takes them out for uſes. Now Spatulaes are broad at one end, like the blade of a bone, which the Barbarians call <hi>Spatulae.</hi>

                        <p>The figure of theſe Spatulaes is all one, to wit, triangular and oblong, but their matter diverſe; for ſome are made of Silver, as thoſe little ones which Chirurgeous uſe; others of Wood, as thatrudicle, wherewith they agitate the palmeous Emplaiſter while it is cocting, which is made of a Palm-bough; others of Iron, as almoſt all the reſt, whether great or ſmall, wherewith Apotheca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries work their ſoft Medicaments, as Honey, Winter-oyl, liquid Electuaries, and the like confections.</p>
                        <p>The Shop-ſpoons are made of Iron and Copper; the Table-ſpoons of Silver, and of Wood for the Ruſtick and poorer people; they make little ones of Ivory and Horn, which ſerve for meaſuring all Powders, and putting them into the ſcales. Many alſo of theſe
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:37350:299"/>materials are uſed in Kitchins, to deſpumate decoctions: Wood and Silver Spoons are alſo uſed in Shops, but not Glaſs ones, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are ſo eaſily frangible; nor Iron ones, becauſe they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract ruſt, as Braſen ones alſo: but they may uſe any of them, ſo the ſervants have a care to keep them clean, and abſterge them as ſoon as they are inquinated.</p>

                        <p>Rich men for ſanity, or rather vanities ſake, have ſuch veſſels of Silver, that the cocted water may not ſmell of Copper.</p>
                        <p>A Diſh is another braſen veſſel, much broader and larger, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Simples are cocted, Compounds made, and Fruits condited: it hath two ears or handles, on each ſide one, that it may be ſet on, or taken off the fire more eaſily: it is ſet on the fire upon a three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>footed Iron Inſtrument, with hot coals under it, that the liquor therein contained may boil.</p>
                        <p>A Pottenger is another aeneous, ſmall, but patulous veſſel; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto a long ſtart, and a ferreous handle is ſuffixed, that it may be more commodiouſly ſet on the fire, and holden in either hand.</p>

                        <p>There ſhould be two Preſſes in each Pharmacopoly; one to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs aqueous ſucces out of green fruits and herbs; and another, ole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous out of Olives.</p>

                        <p>PHarmacopoliſts have now got a cuſtom, to call thoſe Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which ſeparate the purer portion of the Medicament from the craſſer, Sieves: but this ruſtick enunciation is too licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and abuſive; ſince ruſticks Sieves, not Apothecaries Inſtruments, are made of skins perviated with many, but ſmall holes, to purge Corn with.</p>
                        <p>There are alſo other Sieves made of Horſes hairs, intertexed like a web, to ſegregate the Bran from flower; which Aromataries ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times uſe in dividing their Powders, and purging their Prunes, and Caſſia-Fiſtula, from their ſtones and ſeed, which by them are called ſeraceous ſubcirnicles, and ſometimes excuſsive incernicles, becauſe agitated betwixt their hands they excuſs the ſmall Powder. They are ſometimes made of Wood, as when Teile-bark is diſcerpted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to long and ſmall fibres, and lattice-wiſe connexed, for the cribra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of craſſer Powders.</p>
                        <p>There are many common Sieves, but one peculiar to Aromataries; which being contexed with more artifice, they call <hi>Tamis:</hi> it is
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:37350:300"/>ſometimes made of Horſes hair, often of fine linen, and ofteſt of ſilk, operculated above and below with a Rams skin upon a bend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing VVood, that the Powder received in the one casket, may by cribration paſs into the other, without any loſs by proſili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                        <p>Some of theſe are leſs then others, which are more idoneous, for ſuparating precious Powders, which are onely ſoftly holden in ones hard, and the Powder delabes without violence; others do not tranſmit the tenuious Powder without much percuſſion.</p>
                        <p>There is yet another kinde of ſieve, in form of a great box, much in uſe; in whoſe middle a certain web is intended, through which the Powders ſuperimpoſed, fall into the inferiour part of the box: The trajection of the Powder will be more eaſie and quick, if a Tinne or Silver weight be ſuperpoſed together with the Powder, that by its motion and gravity may impel the excuſſive ſieve againſt ſome ſolid body.</p>
                        <p>All ſieves and incernicles ſerving to ſegregate dry things, muſt be moved, agitated, and impelled; but for moiſt things, they muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main quiet and immote; yet the trajection of the things to be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated, may be helped by a Spoon or Manipulus; as the pulpes of Tamarinds, Caſſia, or Prunes; as alſo Roots and herbs firſt cocted to putrelage, then tranſmitted by this adjument, for the confection of Cataplaſms.</p>

                        <p>NEither can Pharmacopolies be without colatories of ſilk, linen, Canvas, and Woolen; ſome whereof are rare, others denſe, and others indifferent; and ſome again, are new, others almoſt worn; and yet the neweſt are moſt uſed, becauſe the whole ſucce of the thing to be ſtrained, may by more valid compreſſure be educed, without the fracture of the cloath.</p>
                        <p>But ſometimes theſe, ſometimes the weaker are taken, according to the conſiſtency of the ſucces: thoſe that are of themſelves tenuious, need a denſer ſtrainer, leſt the tenuious part be not onely tranſmitted, but ſome groſs matter with it. Thoſe that are craſs and viſcid, muſt he trajected through a rare ſtrainer; thoſe of a middle conſiſtency, through a cloth of a middle denſity.</p>
                        <p>Craſs and viſcid ſucces require three things; ſtrong percolation, more ample dilution, and a rarer colatory or ſtrainer: they muſt alſo be calified before collation; for ſo their denſity will be more rarified, and they more eaſily tranſmeate; yea, many will not percolate at all, unleſs they be very hot, others when cold, and ſome onely warm: ſome need onely one colature, others two, and others more; the firſt colature muſt be in a rare ſtrainer, the ſecond in a denſe one, and the third in a more compact one, that paſſage may be obſtructed to

                        <p>There are certain VVoolen Strainers, of a long and pyramidall figure, numerated amongſt theſe colatories, which they call <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> his ſleeves, wherein the Hippocratical VVine is twice or thrice ſtrained, till it be clear.

                        <p>SOme Furnaces ſerve onely for decoctions, and receive Kettles, Diſhes, Caldrons, and other veſſels; wherein ſimples are coct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, prepared and compounded: others for diſtillations, and receive Cucurbites, Retorts, Bladders, Pots, and other veſſels, accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Diſtillations; made either by Aſcent, or Deſcent.</p>
                        <p>Thoſe that ſerve for decocting Medicaments, are not of one ſort; for ſome are portatile and rotund, made of molten or beaten Iron; which as their inferiour parts ſtand upon three valid legs, ſo doth their ſuperiour emit three oblong auricles, more prominent then the Furnaces lips, whereon the Veſſels to be calified are ſuperimpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>
                        <p>Their ſupream part is patulous, like ſome gaping Morter; into which coals are immitted; a Gridiron, or ferreous trabicles, being ſuppoſited, which may give way to the falling aſhes, which are after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards extracted out of the poſternal door, ſtructed for that purpoſe: others are made of Clay, and Bricks; which are almoſt quadrate, fixed, and immoveable, ſtanding upon no feet, but within like the other.</p>
                        <p>Thoſe which ſerve for diſtillations, whether we look at the matter whereof, or form wherein, they are made, are multifarious; for ſome are made of Iron, others of Copper, others of Potters earth, others of common clay, Bricks, and other buſineſſes requiſite to ſtructure; furthermore, ſome are round, as the Metalline Furnaces, which have ears on both ſides, that they may be carried by others; Quadrilaterous, Pentagonous, Multifarious, fixed, and immoveable; wherein three Prothecaries are made; the Inferiour, the Superiour, and the Middle.</p>
                        <p>The inferiour receives the aſhes, and is thence called the <hi>Cireriſt,</hi> or by the uſual Chymical term, <hi>Coniſtery;</hi> whereinto a door opens, by which the burning coals are ventilated by the wind, the Pabulum ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peditated to the fire, and the aſhes extracted: the middle Region of the Furnace, wherein the fire is, which is divided from the <hi>Coniſtery</hi> by a certain craticle, is called <hi>Focus</hi> by the latter age; for in it is the fomentation of the calour, which califies the ſuperimpoſed, in the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour

                        <p>And as ſtructure of the diſtillative Furnaces is various, ſo is it in many elegant: for ſome are built like a Tower, like a Tortoiſe, and Simple, which onely contain one veſſel; others are ſtructed with very much artifice, and are manifold, aſſurging with five or more turricles, each one whereof contains a peculiar veſſel; thus one veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel may be full of hot water, to diſtil by a bath; another of aſhes; another of ſand; another of another matter, according to the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſcope of the Operator: but I would have a Pharmacopoly fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with thus many Furnaces, ſeeing it is made for Medicaments, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then Inſtruments.</p>

                        <p>But its more anguſt ſignification, denotes onely a certain beaked diſtillatory veſſel, joyned to another veſſel, contained in the ſuperiour part of the furnace; and ſuch are our Alembicks, of Lead, Glaſs, or Potters-clay, whether uniform, or acuminated above, broad below, like a bell, whence they are ſo called: yet ſome are capitated and round, and often obvallated with a certain refrigerative veſſel, which they ſometimes call a Capitel, ſometimes a Hat; becauſe as the Head is covered with a Hat, ſo is that receptacle or veſſel, which contains the ſtillatitious matter; whoſe various form alters its denomination, covered with an Alembick. It is ſometimes call'd a Cucurbite; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a Bladder; ſometimes Boccia, Matratium, a Pot, and other names.</p>
                        <p>But the Bell, whether it be alone, or ſet on the receptacle, is called an Alembick; whereof there are two main differences, the one is beaked, which emits a long channel, propendent like the ſnout of an Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant, through which condenſed vapours delabe into the ſuppoſited veſſel; the other wants this tube, and is called a blind Alembick: this is proper to the Chymiſts, who uſe it in ſublimation, as the beaked one in diſtillation: ſome of theſe have ſuch a long tube, that
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:37350:302"/>they can traject it through the middle of a hogs-head, full of cold water; which concretes, and contemperates the delabing water better.</p>
                        <p>Many have a beak deflected like a Serpent or Worm, which name it holds; and is moſt accommodate to diſtil <hi>Aqua vitae,</hi> which the Chymiſts call <hi>Elixir vitae.</hi>

                        <p>The magnitude alſo, and figure of the receptacles, are various; for ſome are very ample, and bellied; others ſo ſmall, that they exceed not the magnitude of a Walnut; and theſe are deſtinated to Chymical operations: others are moderate in capacity, ſome whereof are ſtraight, as Vials, Urinals, Pots, Cucurbites, whether greater or leſs, and Separatories; others inflicted, as Retorts, a crooked Boccia, called Cornumuſe.</p>
                        <p>Thoſe things are diſtilled in ſtraight Cucurbites, which are eaſily ſublevated on high; as Roots, Seeds, Leaves, Flowers, and Ato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mata's; thoſe in oblique ones, which are not ſo eaſily elevated, as Roſins, Lachrymae, Fats and Gums.</p>

                        <head>CHAP. 13. <hi>Of the Conſervation of whole or parts of Simples in a Pharmacopoly.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p>THe number of Simples which a Pharmacopoliſt ſtands in need of, is indefinitive: for ſeeing all things ſown or produced, all things on which man conculcates, or which he can handle, are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigible to his ſubſidy; He that would in a ſhort Catalogue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plect all Medicinal Materials, undertakes no leſs, then he that would depinge in a very ſmall Table, the vaſtity of the Univerſe. <hi>Nic. Praepoſitus</hi> indeed, in the beginning of his Antidotary, in many Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pters recenſeates many Simples, wherewith the Apothecary ſhould be furniſhed: but without doubt he hath not mentioned the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dredth part of all that ſerve to Medicinal uſes: for every land brings not forth every Medicament; but that which <hi>Nic.</hi> knew, ſome; this that he never ſaw, others whereof he never made tryal nor heard: out of <hi>India,</hi> and other Foraign Countreys, ſome Simples are brought, never before ſeen, nor known to us, and that daily.</p>
                        <p>And however, though to recenſeate all Simples, and deſcribe the name and form of ſuch as are of diuturnal uſe, be burthenſome and ſuperfluous, ſeeing ſpecial Phyſicians undertaking this task, have not ſo ſatisfied the mindes of young men, but many of them will ſay, That they have either forgotten many, or ſpoken of many ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluouſly: But let ſuch Sycophants with-hold, whom <hi>Jupiter</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf cannot pleaſe: we will proſecute our purpoſe, and recenſeate the chief Simples which ſhould be conſerved in Pharmacopolies.</p>
                        <p>And theſe Simples of uſe, are either green or dry; the green are partly ſuppeditated by the vicine Countrey, partly by Gardens; which may be depromed from each, when need requires; as Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſian Plants from Gardens, and Sylveſtrian from Woods, and
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:37350:303"/>other rural and incultivated places. Wherefore it were needleſs to deduce all green Plants, whereof the Apothecary hath diuturnal uſe, into his Pharmacopoly, and ſo ſuperfluous for him to be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed and ſurrounded with theſe; when it is enough for him to have a few of them at opportune ſeaſons, when exigence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires.</p>
                        <p>For a heap of green Simples, by long aſſervation, putrefie, and both their quality and quantity are worſted. Therefore the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecaries act prudently, who collect or buy green herbs onely for a half or a whole week; for it were folly for a man to onerate his ſhop with Mallows, Violets, Mercury, Brankurfine, Pelletory of the wall, Fumatory, Endive, Sowthiſtle, Purſlane, Borrage, Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bane, and innumerable ſuch others, which are uſed onely green, and collected in ſmall quantity. Wherefore it were ridiculous to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude theſe in bags, or repoſe them in boxes, when he may eaſily, when exigence calls for them, deprome them out of gardens or countrey; or if their ſeaſon be paſt, by the Phyſicians advice ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute ſome other.</p>
                        <p>Dry ones therefore are onely neceſſary to be kept; as of Roots, the five apertives, and many other alteratives and purgatives; as the Roots of Cypres, Angelica, Enula-campana, Graſs, Liquorice, the greater Madder, Tormentil, Biſtort, Oinone, Gentian, Poeony, Orris-graſs, Acorus, Galingal, Ginger, Sweet-cane, both Berth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worts, Aſarum, Sowbread, Bartram, Dittany, Avens, both the Ferns, Water-betony, Sea-Holly, Ragwort, Bugloſs, Sorrel, Chyna, Sarſaparilla, Marſhmallows, the ſea-Onyon, Garlick, the greater Comfrey, Bryony, Mechoacam, Turbith, Polypody, Rhaponticum, Meadow-ſaffron, Rhabarb, VValwort, both the Hellebores, and others leſs uſual; beſides thoſe that are uſurped green.</p>
                        <p>Of cauls and leaves, theſe are eſpecially to be preſerved: both the VVormwoods, Mint, Balſamite, Southernwood, Germander, Groundpine, Hyſſop, Calamint, Nep, Horehound, Peny-royal, Winterſavery, Thyme, Origanum, Dill, Rue, Lavender, Marjo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran, Baſil, mother of Thyme, Clary, Scordium, Chamomile, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lilot, Centory, Cetrach, Dittany, Dodder, <hi>S.</hi> Johns-wort, Knot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graſs, Betony, Balm, Roſemary, Travellers-joy, Fluellen, Vervine, Marſhmallows, yellow Henbane, Mullen, Stoechas, Tamarisk, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-wort, Polium, Senna, Laureol, and Bayes.</p>

                        <p>Seeds neceſſary to be kept, are the four greater Refrigeratives, the four leſſer Refrigeratives, and the ſeed of Marſhmallows, Arach, Radiſh, Barberies, Plantain, Quinces, Fleabit, Line, Foenugreek, Cumin, Dill, Aniſeed, Fennel, Coriander, Agnus Caſtus, Ladies Roſe, Burdock, Baſtard-ſaffron, Dwarf, Elder, Petroſeline, Smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage,

                        <p>Many Fruits alſo muſt be kept in Pharmacopolies; as, both ſweet and bitter Almonds, all ſorts of Nuts, Oranges, Citrons, odoriferous Apples, Ruſſetins, Coloquintido, Sorb-apples, the fruit of the Cornel-tree, Prunes, Dates, Mulberries, Figs, Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Jujubees, Galls, Olives, Capers, Cypreſs-Nuts, Acorns, Tamarinds, Myrobalans, Cherries,

                        <p>Barks and Cores are either pilled off the Roots of Plants, as the bark of the Root of the Capers ſhrub, or of the trunk of Plants, as Cinamon; or of their Fruits, as of Oranges, Lem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, Pomegranates, and the like: few whereof need be preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, becauſe when exigence calls for them, they may be taken of the Fruits and Roots.</p>
                        <p>Many Gummes are neceſſary; as Ammoniacum, Galbanum, Sagapenum, Bdellium, Opoponax, Aſſa-foetida, Roſin, clarified Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin, Tragacanth, Storax, Gumme-Elemni, Cedri, of the Cherry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree, Ivy, Prune, Juniper, Arabick, Maſtick, Gumme-Lacc.

The effect alſo, beſides the Teſtimony of perite men, ſhews, that there are eximious faculties in Metals; for Gold beaten into thin leaves, and taken with other idoneous Medicaments, cures many affections: <hi>Avicenna</hi> preſcribes it chiefly to ſuch as are Melancholical, and to ſuch as ſhould have their faculties roborated, or ſpirits exhilarated; and hence its duſt is exhibited by the rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, either in cordial confections, which receive of its leaves, as <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rea Alexandrina,</hi> the confection of <hi>Alkermes,</hi> and <hi>Electuarium de Gem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Gold is Chieftain amongſt Metals, next Silver, then Braſs, Tinne, Lead, and Iron: ſome adde a ſeventh, to wit, Mercury, which is a Metal rather potentially, then actually; but there are almoſt innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Minerals, as all the ſorts of earths, amongſt which Lemnia holds the chief ſeat; then, Bole-Oriental, then Erethrian, Setenuſian, Samian, and Synopical earth, with Ocre, and ſuch Minerals as are effoded out of the bowels of the Earth; as foſſile Salts, Lime, Talkum, Miſy, Sory, Red-Lead, Chalk, Vitriol, Chryſocolla, Auri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pigmentum, Alom, Sulphur, Chryſtal, Stibium; and ſuch as cleave to Metals, or are collected out of Furnaces wherein Metals are melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as the flower of Braſs, Cadmia, Ceruſe, Braſs-Scales, Lead-Ocre, Pompholix, Spodium, Litharge, and the droſs of Braſs.</p>
                        <p>Many ſtones alſo are much celebrated amongſt Minerals, which for their eximious vertues, and pulchritude, are called precious ſtones; as the Saphyr, Ruby, Carbuncle, Emerald, Hyacinth, Granatus, Topaz, Beril, Achates, Sarda, Carchedony, Haematites, Jaſper, Selenite, Magner, Pumic, and Alome: whereunto we may adde thoſe thoſe that are elicited out of the Sea and waters; as odorate Amber, Sea-Salt, Whales-ſpume, Bitumen, Coral, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, Jeat, Antal, Dental, Coralin, Spunges, and ſome others, which being indued with a more imbecile faculty in Medicine, are omitted.</p>

                        <p>Inſects are integrally uſurped, ſuch as be Spaniſh-Flyes, Aſels, Worms, Lizards, Ants, Vipers, Scorpions, Frogs, Crabs, Swallows, and ſome littles Birds.</p>

                        <p>And ſeeing excrements have their Medicinal vertues, Pharmaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poliſts muſt alſo have them in keeping; as Goats, Dogs, Storks, Peacocks, and Stock-Doves dung; Sheeps greaſe, Silk, Musk, Civet, and the hairs of ſome Animals.</p>

                           <p>HOw neceſſary a Method is in delivering of Diſciplines, I think is well known to any moderately-learned man: For without a method, there is no certain rule, neither for Learner or Teacher to walk by: but with this, Arts are more firmly eſtabliſhed, their Theorems more optably read, and eaſily learned. Yet you ſhall ſcarce finde two, who in writing Antidotaries, have kept in one rode, or diſpoſed their Compounds in one or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. Some prepoſterouſly propoſe <hi>Nic. Praepoſitus</hi> for their example; who himſelf imitating one <hi>Nic. Alexandrinus,</hi> out of whoſe Works he excerpt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thoſe his Works, he calls <hi>[Joan. Agricol.

Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius, Fernelius,</hi> and <hi>Joubertus,</hi> of the later Writers, have aſſayed by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Laws and Rules, to eſtabliſh an orderly and duly-diſpoſed method; yet they much diſſent among themſelves; and what one of them approves, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſapproves: yet all think that order is beſt, which curation preſcribes: for a ſeries of words onely demonſtrate.</p>
                           <p>We have obſerved this method in our Shop, wherein are contained all Medicaments, for the expugnation of all diſeaſes; not confuſedly deſcribed, but ſuch as muſt be introſumed, are digeſted in the former part of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidotary,

Each Book is diſterminated into many Sections, and they ſubdivided into many Chapters; the firſt whereof treats of Syrupes; and firſt of ſuch as are made of the firſt and Spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowers, as Syrupe of Violets, Syrupe of Coltsfoot, and of the flowers of Peach-trees.</p>

                           <p>Nature alone confects no Syrups, but they acquire their mixtion, coction, and conſiſtence, by Art: yet that which is made of Violets, Water, and Sugar onely, is called a ſimple Syrupe, in reference to the more compound; which beſides theſe, admit of the ſeeds of Quinces, Mallowes, Jujubs, Sebeſten, and the water of Gourds; whoſe Authour they make <hi>Meſue:</hi> but, that I know of, I never found it thus confected in him. That which we call the Simple Syrupe is made in every Pharmacopoly, but not alike ſimply confected: for it is ſometimes made of the ſucce of Violets and Sugar, ſometimes of the ſame, infuſed and expreſſed twice, thrice or oftener; for many infuſe and macerate new Violets ſeven times, others eight, and ſome nine. But <hi>Fernelius</hi> thinks that ſo oft iterated infuſion is needleſs: They in vain (ſaith he) reiterate the maceration of Violets nine times, for Syrupe of Violets; ſeeing after the third or fourth infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, the Syrupe will be as efficacious as after more: But I think that better which is confected by many infuſions.</p>
                           <p>Some put the expreſſed ſucce of Violets, others the conſerve of Violets, in this ſyrupe, incraſſated by coction, to make it more Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laceous: others make it of pure ſucce of Violets, and white ſugar; others coct their ſugar firſt, to the conſiſtence of an Electuary, and afterwards, with the ſaid ſucce of Violets, into the craſſitude of a ſyrupe.</p>
                           <p>Many put a difference betwixt the ſyrupe of Violets, and the Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laceous ſyrupe; calling that the ſyrupe of Violets, which is made of
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:37350:307"/>purged flowers, and that violaceous, which is made of integral and not purged ones: and this indeed hath leſs of Violets faculties in it, but it is more ſolutive; for the herbaceous part is emollitive, as well as its leaves: ſome put onely four pounds of ſugar to five of ſucce, and coct it into the conſiſtence of a ſyrupe.</p>
                           <p>Syrupe of Violets breaks the acrimony of Choler, tempers the heat of the bowels, ſubduces the belly,
<note place="margin">Qualitates.</note> and conduces to the vices of the breaſt. It is a ſpecial auxiliatory in pectoral and lateral inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations, and againſt the roughneſs of the <hi>Aſpera arteria:</hi> and is very good againſt the heat of Fevers, cholerick and acute diſeaſes, the ardour of the intrails, and will quench thirſt.</p>

                           <p>This ſyrupe is denominated from Tuſſilage, as from its baſis, which ingredes it in greater quantity: Its author is uncertain, and thence its preparation various. But we have exhibited the beſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, appointing the four preſcribed ſimples, to be cocted in four pounds of water, but lightly.</p>
                           <p>Thoſe that make this ſyrupe in the beginning of the ſpring, take only the flowers of Tuſſilage; thoſe that make it in ſummer, adde as much of the green leaves, as they take of its green flowers. Some make it in the middle of ſummer, onely of the ſucce of its leaves depurated, and ſugar: it may be very well made of the decoction of the flowers and ſugar, and be called ſimple ſyrupe, in reference to the former more compound, which admits of the true Maidens-hair; in ſtead whereof, Polytrichum may be ſubſtituted.</p>
                           <p>It helps ſhortneſs and difficulty of breathing, the aſperity of the windpipe; it cocts, moves, and expectorates ſpittle: but it muſt be licked like an Eclegm, that it may ſtick longer in the Oſophage, and reach the amplitude of the aſper artery.</p>

                           <p>This ſyrupe is either made of the fruits, or the flowers of the Peach-tree: that which is made of its fruits is ſeldom in uſe, as <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtophorus, Meſues</hi> commentator, confeſſes; and it is made in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of Autume, as that of the flowers in the beginning of the Spring. Three things require that this ſyrupe be made of fewer infuſions; to wit, the loſs, penury and amaritude of the flowers: the loſs of the flowers, which can be regained by no Art; for the flowers being evelled, new ones grow not again that year, and the tree remains fruitleſs: the Penury of them; for this tree is ſative onely, and without culture bears no fruit: their Amaritude, which will be more intolerable, by how much the infuſions are more.</p>

                           <p>Some put not ſo much ſugar to it, but coct it longer, till it grow thick; and then it is more purgative, but leſs grateful to the palate: many following <hi>Meſues</hi> advice, keep the firſt, though twice-iterated infuſion in a glaſs well operculated, putting Oyl upon it, and inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating it forty days; and they call this maceration of Roſes, not expreſſed, but infuſed <hi>Mucharum Roſarum.</hi>

                           <p>It is fure enough, that this ſyrupe hath been but of late uſe, for they of our age invented it; and, being imboldened by much
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:37350:309"/>experience, approved of it. <hi>Joannes Gonerius,</hi> a Pariſian Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cary, and perite Medick, firſt made it at <hi>Paris;</hi> who ſeeing the Plant whereof it was made, coming from the <hi>Turenian</hi> fields, ſought and found great plenty of it in fields near <hi>Paris,</hi> and of them he made his ſyrupe annually, not borrowing elſwhere. It is variouſly called, to wit, <hi>Hiſpudula, Guaphilium, Coronario, Aelurope,</hi> or <hi>Cats<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foot;</hi> and improperly <hi>Harts-foot.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>This ſyrupe is multifariouſly made; and yet none hath hitherto publiſhed its confections: ſome onely take the ſummities of the Plant, or its Down, and macerate them in water; others take its flowers and leaves; to whom I eaſily aſſent: for thus it becomes more aſtrictive, and more convenient to ſtay fluxes; others adde to its decoction, Liquorice, Jujubs, Raiſins, Barley, and other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chical matters. But this deſcription we have exhibited, is moſt uſual; whereunto, if we adde half a pound of roſaceous ſugar, its quality will be more bechical and cordial, and its ſapour more gracious.</p>
                           <p>The manner of its preparation is ſo eaſie, that it needs no further dilucidation, then that which is in its perſpicuous deſcription: if no Plant but the dry one can be got, then its quantity muſt be leſs, and the waters greater.</p>
                           <p>This ſyrupe is eximious againſt many affections of the Lungs: for,
<note place="margin">Vires.</note> Aelurope or Hiſpudula, being a vulnerary Plant, and aſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive, it doth not onely cure wounds, and hinder Ulcers, but heal many other vices. It is moſt convenient for ſuch as have fluxes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending into their breaſt, or have their Lungs infarciated with much pituitous humours: for it cohibits the violence of the falling humour, cocts the flux, roborates the part affected, and moves ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectoration.</p>

                           <p>Vulgar Apothecaries call this Syrupe <hi>Diacodium,</hi> but imperitely; for Diacodium is repoſed among the Opiates: yet one may ſupply the defect of the other, when ſleep ſhould be conciliated.</p>
                           <p>Poppies heads, by <hi>Galens</hi> advice, muſt be ſo long cocted after ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceration, till they be flaccid and marcid, and not till the third or fourth part of the water be left; for we cannot expreſs their ſucce, but when they are marcid: and therefore it is in vain to coct them longer. Rain-water is the beſt; in defect whereof, we may uſe fountain-water, if it be limpid, inſipid, and void of qualities; and therefore the water conducted in leaden pipes, muſt not be accepted, becauſe there is mud in them: and hence, he that drinks the dregs of ſuch water, will be overtaken with the Dyſentery, though in other caſes they be wholeſome.</p>
                           <p>The Ancients Diacodium was made in form of an Opiate, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ungrateful; for it admitted of no ſugar, but many inſuave, and it is probable, uſeleſs things: it is not now made, but in its ſtead, this ſyrupe made of the decoction of Poppies heads and ſugar, which many call improperly Diacodium.</p>
                           <p>Syrupe of Poppy conciliates ſleep,
<note place="margin">Vires.</note> mitigates the temper of the cholerick humour, and allayes the Cough: it becomes more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chical, by the acceſs of <hi>Penidia,</hi> which the Arabians call <hi>Alpheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum,</hi> becauſe of its whiteneſs: for it is a moſt white confection of ſugar, ſo long cocted in the decoction of Barley, till it acquires a ductile conſiſtence, and may be handled, ducted, and formed with ones hands into Paſtils and Rowls intorted like ropes.</p>

The <hi>Pariſian</hi> Apothecaries make it accurately, according to the deſcription here given, and it is moſt eximiouſly Medicinal: they that do otherwiſe, mixing but a ſmall quantity of capillaries, and macerating them lightly, make indeed a pellucid ſyrupe, but both in colour and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue aqueous, and ſo defraud the Patient of his expectation, and the Phyſician of his ſcope.</p>

<note place="margin">Vires.</note> for it is very uſeful to oppugne all affections of the breaſt, liver, ſpleen, reins, uterus, and to tenuate and prepare humours: for it tempers and cocts choler, incides phlegme, makes the melancholical humour eaſie to be expurged, yea often ſubduces the belly by much uſe; it moves expectoration, incides and cocts the humours contained in the Lungs, and educes them by a ſecond purge.</p>

                              <hi>Nicolaus Praepoſitus,</hi> whom moſt Apothecaries have as preſident, doubles the quantity of Rhabarb preſcribed eight times, and addes four ounces of Rhabarb to every pound of ſyrupe; ſo that for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ounce of ſyrupe, there are four dragms of Rhabarb: and thus it is made all over <hi>Paris.</hi> That it may be exhibited when uſe calls for it without delay, ſome onely quadruplicate or triplicate the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity.

Yet they act prudently, that make it with eight times as much Rhabarb: though its faculties be more imbecile, yet it hath other qualities thereby bettered.</p>
                           <p>The ſyrupe of Succory, compounded with Rhabarb, is alliotical,
<note place="margin">Qualitates.</note> roborative, and purgative: it allayes the heat of the intrails, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulceates the acrimony of choler, opens the veins, takes away ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, roborates the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                           <p>There are two deſcriptions of the ſyrupe of Fumatory; the one more compound, conſiſting of more ingredients; the other leſs, conſiſting onely of the ſucce of Fumatory and Sugar: The firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hard to make, they often put to young Apprentices at <hi>Paris,</hi> to try their ingeny; and a ſyrupe prepared of thoſe Simples, which are deſcribed in its form, is very inſuave in odour and ſapour, and black of colour: and therefore it cannot be an Alterative Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, becauſe ingrateful and ignave; nor yet Purgative, becauſe inefficacious: it is better therefore to keep the Simple ſyrupe in Pharmacopolies. Now that it may be rightly made, the ſucce of
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:37350:312"/>the Fumatory muſt be depurated in the ſun; when clarified, mixed with an equal weight of ſugar, if the ſyrupe muſt be ſweet; if not, leſs: But when the Fumatory's amaritude would be ingrateful, it muſt be dulcorated with more ſugar.</p>
                           <p>Now Fumatory is a vulgar Plant, whereof there are two ſorts; the one Hortenſian and bulbous, which is ſeldome uſed in Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine; the other equally growing in cultivated and incultivated fields: of whoſe ſucce this ſyrupe is made.</p>

That it may be duly made, the brayed Bugloſs muſt lie in a moiſt and cold place a whole night, or a day; then it muſt be calified and expreſſed; for its ſucce being viſcid, will not otherwiſe be eaſily educed: when it is expreſſed, it muſt ſtand, to ſubſide.

                           <p>The COMMENTARY.</p>
                           <p>Though this ſyrupe may be made at any time, yet we ſubjoyn it to the former, becauſe they have much affinity betwixt their facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: it is called Oxyſacharum, for the Vinegar and Sugar whereof it conſiſts. That it may be rightly made, <hi>Meſue</hi> would have it cocted in Earthen, Tinne, or a Stone-veſſel; not Braſs or Copper, as ſome do: ſome would have diſtilled Vinegar; but its quality being very ſharp, it hurts the ventricle and nerves: the common Vinegar is better, and more accommodate, whoſe various proportions the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour may preſcribe, as the Medick would have it ſharper, or leſs ſharp.</p>
                           <p>It refrigerates hot humours, incides craſs and viſcid ones,
<note place="margin">Qualitates.</note> attenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates and prepares them for expulſion; it arceates putretude, quenches thirſt, and allayes the inflammation of the bowels.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Myrepſus</hi> exhibits another ſimple ſyrupe of Vinegar, whoſe uſe I approve of; and it is thus deſcribed:</p>

                           <p>It is made as the former; and both of them are called Simple ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupes, in diſtinction to another more compound, whoſe deſcription <hi>Nic. Praepoſitus</hi> gives: But ſeeing it is of rare or no uſe, we ſhall omit it.</p>
                           <p>This incides craſs humours, moves and impels them, if inherent;
<note place="margin">Vires.</note> allays calid humours, refrigerates the heat of the ventricle and liver, and emends the corruption of the humours: or any ſyrupe of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar kills worms, whether in the Inteſtines or in the Veins; as I ſaw in one of <hi>Paris,</hi> in whoſe baſilical Vein was a worm of a palms length.</p>

                           <p>Both the ſyrupes are uſually made; but he may omit the Simple one, that makes the Compound; as alſo the Compound ſyrupe of Vinegar, for it will ſupply the want of both. The Arabians call it <hi>Dynari,</hi> becauſe it purges the Ureters; not from <hi>Denarium,</hi> a piece of Money, as ſome think: neither can I credit <hi>Bern: Deſſennius,</hi> who ſaith, That this Name was invented by an inept and covetous fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, who by <hi>Dynari</hi> portended ſome ſum of Money.</p>
                           <p>It is called the Byzantian ſyrupe, from <hi>Byzantium,</hi> or <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> where it is very frequent, or was invented; or elſe becauſe <hi>Meſue</hi> had its deſcription from ſome <hi>Byzantian</hi> Medick.</p>
                           <p>This ſyrupe opens,
<note place="margin">Vires.</note> incides, and attenuates: it frees the Liver from obſtructions, as alſo the Spleen and Meſentery: it helps the Jaundies, moves fluors, and cures Fevers, which ariſe from viſcid humours.</p>

<pb n="513" facs="tcp:37350:314"/>the ſyrupe of Mulberries; to whoſe confection, ſome now adde the ſucce of Raſsberries, and of Straw-berries, thus confecting it of three kindes of Berries; others leave both out, and ſape alſo: the ſucces muſt be cocted with honey, to the conſiſtence of a ſyrupe, which is more dilute then Diamorum, or Rob of Mulberries, which is now ſeldome made, moſt uſing this compound ſyrupe in its ſtead.</p>
                           <p>The ſimple ſyrupe of Mulberries alſo is very good, which is made of their ſucce and ſugar; whereunto, if you adde a little Roſe-water, it will be more grateful, and efficacious in roborating, and ſtaying fluxes.</p>

                           <p>The vulgar French call this <hi>Groſſula rubra,</hi> the Moors <hi>Riben,</hi> and the ſhop-men <hi>Ribes:</hi> they are ſmall, round, red fruits, racemouſly coherent, pregnant with much ſucce and ſmall ſtones, which tunded and preſſed, emit a ſucce; which, after clarification and colation, muſt be mixed with ſugar: but the ſugar muſt be added in leſs quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity to this, then other cold ſucces; becauſe this ſucce will keep long without corruption; and becauſe; by too much ſugar, its per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful acidity will be obtunded, and the ſyrupe weakened.</p>
                           <p>Berberries ſucce muſt alſo be ſo extracted, and ſo cocted with ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar into a ſyrupe. Berberries is a word deduced from <hi>Avicenna</hi>'s Amyrberis, which <hi>Dodoneus</hi> makes Oxyacantha.</p>

                              <hi>Meſue</hi> makes it as the ſyrupe of the ſucce of Citrons; therefore he confects it of Omphacium and a Julep, which is of water and ſugar, in a Tinne or Potters-veſſel, not in a braſen or copper one; the Omphacium muſt firſt be cocted to the thirds, then the ſugar muſt be added, which muſt firſt be cocted in thrice as much water, and clarified; then the mixture muſt be fervefied into the conſiſtence of a fyrupe. Some (ſaith <hi>Meſue</hi>) adde Cloves; but they are bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter left out. Their cuſtome is commendable, who firſt coct ſugar to the conſiſtence of an Electuary: whereunto, they then adde the ſucce, and coct them lightly into a ſyrupe; whereinto, they inject the ſucce of immature Grapes, that it may be more acid.</p>

Some coct the ſugar to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence of a ſolid Electuary: whereupon, they affund their limpid ſucce, agitate it with a Spatula, and by gentle coction reduce it to a Syrupe. And this preparation is good: for thus the faculty of the ſucces is not obtunded by the fire, but preſerved whole and entire: others elixate the ſucces to the conſumption of their third part, and thereupon affund a ſimple Julep, and coct them into a Syrupe.</p>
                           <p>Some take the ſucces, and dilute them in twice as much ſugar, and withall califie them together, that they may better become a Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupe: and the Syrupe thus confected, will keep beſt, and hath a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry idoneous conſiſtence. So the ſucces be acid enough, it may alſo be made by inſolation, without fire, by the addition of more ſugar: But the method preſcribed, is the eaſieſt, ſhorteſt, and beſt way of making it, and moſt in uſe.</p>

                           <p>Theſe ſyrupes, by the conſent of the Author, may be made either with Honey or Sugar: but that is better, and more ſuave, which admits of Sugar; whereof <hi>Fernelius</hi> addes twice the quantity to the ſucce: but the more uſual way of confecting the compound, admits of onely two pounds of Sugar; as <hi>Meſue</hi> hints, who in his own idiome, calls Dulcoacid and Semi-mature fruits, <hi>Muzae,</hi> that is, pleaſant; for then their ſapour arrides the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack.

                           <p>But if the Mint be dry, its quantity is greater; for it is enough that one pound ten ounces be cocted in the ſucces, and as much Sugar added to this Colature; for it will be very inſuave, if made as <hi>Meſue</hi> deſcribes it.</p>

                              <p>The reſumptive ſyrupes, in a general acception, may be referred to all analepticall and reſtorative ones; wherein Medicks adhibit Snails fleſh, after the example of that, whereof <hi>Joannes Tornamyra</hi> is Authour by aſſent; though I could neither ſee it in him, nor any other Antidotariographer in my life: and that which is now made by Medicks, is made after as many different manners, as there are dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Shops wherein it is made; yea all the deſcriptions that I have ſeen of it, (and they were no few) differ among themſelves; ſome ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:37350:320"/>too many attenuatives; others, too viſcid ingredients; others, uſeleſs ones; and others in ſuch a confuſed form, as if they could ſcarce be prepared as deſcribed.</p>
                              <p>All of them require nemoral Snails, which yet, if there be any ſuch, are worſe, as Rubetae amongſt Frogs, becauſe their ſucce is ſharper and more fervid, but leſs nutritive, and apt to reſarciate: therefore I judge the vulgar more wholeſom, which live partly on the water, partly on the land.</p>
                              <p>And <hi>Rondeletius</hi> ſaid true, that Snails could not alwayes live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out water: whence theſe terreſtrial Snails, muſt be ſuch as live in muddy and fenny places, partly on limpid water, and partly on dry land.</p>
                              <p>But they muſt be duly prepared, before they accede the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of this ſyrupe; their necks, tails, and members, muſt be firſt abſcinded, their ſhels divided or ſeparated, that all the fleſh may be extracted, which muſt be purged from all filth, cut into pieces, and cocted together with the Simples enumerated; and thoſe in ſuch order, as they that require longer coction, may be ſooner injected; thoſe that require ſhorter, later.</p>
                              <p>And ſo it were better to coct the ſimples ſeverally from the fleſh, and the fleſh firſt, or laſt, as the Medick will. Sugar and Penidees muſt be added to the Colature.</p>
                              <p>It is good for ſuch as reſurge from long diſeaſes,

                              <pb n="525" facs="tcp:37350:320"/>
                              <p>It is cognominated exhilarative, becauſe it hath an eximious fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty in recreating the heart and vitals, erecting the ſaculties, abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating ſorrow, and tempering the malign quality of melancholy.</p>
                              <p>This ſyrupe may be ſubſtituted, in ſtead of that that is made of Ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, in ſuch parts where the Illex is coccigerous: of which conſection we were not unmindeful; but being eaſie to make, we omitted it, and left to ſuch, whom Nature hath inriched with its eximious ſucce.</p>
                              <p>There are inumerable more deſcriptions of ſyrupes in divers Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors; but ſome of them being diſapproved of, others ſcarce proved, we will not onerate, or rather inquinate our Antidotary therewith.

                              <p>The COMMENTARY.</p>
                              <p>The Honey muſt firſt be cocted in water, and deſpumed; then muſt the Vinegar be by little and little adjected; then all cocted together, till they acquire the conſiſtence of a liquid ſyrupe: But the Ancients have not definitely deſcribed the quantity of Vinegar; for ſeeing Honey, according to <hi>Galen,</hi> is hot, and in hot natures turns ſoon into bile; ſo much Vinegar muſt be added, by <hi>Oribaſius</hi> his advice, as will correct that bilefying faculty; and ſo it may be made into Oxymel, convenient and uſeful for all ages and ſexes: for it is as ſweet, as acid, and as mean, and ſhould be made variouſly according to the guſt of the aſſumer, ſo that it may not hurt: for things very ſharp, abrade the inteſtines, and hinder expectoration; but that which is moderately acrimonious, is very uſeful to the affections of the breaſt and lungs; for it educes ſpittle, and facilitates ſpiration; for it incides and attenuates craſs humours, expurges the bowels without moleſtation, and attenuates mans meat.</p>
                              <p>Its preparation then is various, and the proportion of Honey to Vinegar, and of Vinegar to water, is various; for though the a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous be better to moſt, yet it agrees not to all.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>Oribaſius</hi> would have twice as much Honey, and four times as much water, as Vinegar; and would have them all cocted to the thirds; which is the ſame with that that <hi>Meſue</hi> gives: whereunto, <hi>Serapius</hi> aſſents, though he elſewhere makes them of equal parts; but that is too ſowre.</p>
                              <p>Now the middle betwixt both, may be of one part and a half of Vinegar, to two of the beſt Honey, which emits not much ſpume: for all Honey that emits more ſpume, is not ſo good, but muſt be cocted, and deſpumed longer, and ſo its greateſt part diſſipated in coction: for it muſt be cocted till it effer no more ſpume.</p>
                              <p>Thus the quantity of the Vinegar muſt be augmented and dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed according to the will of the uſer, to whom it is more conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent as he more defires is, and ſo it ſhould be made according to every diſpoſition: yet that which is kept in ſhops, is uſually prepared as <hi>Meſue</hi> hath deſcribed; and is made more ſweet, or more ſowre, as the aſſumer deſires it, and the exigency calls for it.</p>
                              <p>Oxymel incides,
<note place="margin">Vires.</note> attenuates and prepares craſs and viſcid humours for expurgation, conduces equally to hot and cold affections, and effects what we have before mentioned.</p>

                              <p>The Medick <hi>Marcellus</hi> makes it after another manner, by ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adding water. For he takes <hi>of Squils</hi> lb <hi>j.

                                 <hi>Mervardus</hi> alſo, and <hi>Bern.

                              <p>If this Receipt like not any one, he may take water, and coct it to the abſumption of its third part, accurately abſterging and abject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſpume: for thus the more diſſipable part of the water be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vaniſhed, the remnant will have a conſiſtence like a liquid Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupe; its ſapour will be ſweet, and the coction fit for conſervation.</p>
                              <p>Many Medicaments mutuate their baſis and appellations from Honey, as Mulſam, or Mede, Hydromel both aqueous and vinous, Oxymel, and many other Medicinal Honeys; of the ſucces of Plants, as Rhodomel; or Honey of Roſes, Honey of Violets, Mercury, Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſins, Roſemary, and Anacardium.</p>
                              <p>Mede conſiſts onely of Water and Honey, mixed in a different proportion; and that is called dilute Mede, that admits but of lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Honey,
<note place="margin">How to make Mede.</note> and very much water; For we make Mede, ſaith <hi>Oribaſius,</hi> when we mix much water with Honey, and coct them till they ceaſe to emit ſpume; for then the ſpume muſt be taken off: But the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Honey muſt be augmented for pituious humours, both to alter the peccant humour, and to conciliate a more grateful guſt.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>Oribaſius</hi> was out, when he thought that Mede ſhould be made of Wine and Honey, and Melicraſs of Honey and Water: for they are both one. Though <hi>Meſue</hi> calls Melicraſs, Oxymel, and gives two deſcriptions thereof; the one conſiſts of Wine and Honey; the other, beſides theſe two, admits of many Aromata's; as Cloves, Cinamome, ſweet-Cane, Mace, and the like; which by ſome (he aſſenting thereto) is called a Condite.</p>
                              <p>But this kinde of Potion, which conſiſts of Wine and Honey, is called Oinomel;
<note place="margin">Oinomel.</note> it is ſometimes confected of two parts of old Wine, and one of Honey; and ſometimes of five parts of new Wine, and one of Honey: which when cold, is repoſed into Hogs-heads, (<hi>Oribaſius C.</hi> 25. <hi>L.</hi> 5. <hi>Collectorum.</hi>)</p>
                              <p>Simple and vulgar Hydromel is prepared juſt as Melicratum; ſo that they differ onely in name, not in ſubſtance: yet <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licratum
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:37350:322"/>or Mede ſhould be made of rain-water, and Hydromel of fountain-water.</p>
                              <p>Apomeli is made alſo after the like manner; for according to <hi>Galen,</hi> it may be made of rain or any water, ſo it be pure, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney expreſſed from the comb; which muſt be ſo long cocted together till ſpume ceaſe to exurge; which muſt be taken off, as ſoon as it emerges; for ſo it will depoſe its acrimony. The Ancients called it ſyrupe of Honey-combs.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>Philagrius</hi> gives a better deſcription, to a better Apomelie, thus: Let ſome Combs, full of the beſt Honey, be ſtrongly preſſed betwixt ones hands; and let a portion of the honey expreſſed, be injected into four times as much pure water, and let the Honey-Combs be alſo immerged and waſhed in the water, that they may depoſe all their Honey; then let the water be ſtrained, then cocted over a lucu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent fire, and well deſpumed; let it then be taken off, and frigefie, and let what-ever ſwims upon, be abjected; then boyl it again, and deſpume it; which iterate thrice: and when it is at laſt frigefied and purged from its excrements, inject this Apomeli into an Earthen or Wooden Veſſel.</p>
                              <p>Aqueous Hydromel is ſcarce ever preſerved in ſhops, but preſently made, when uſe calls for it; but the vinous is often confected by the Medicks advice, and kept in Citizens houſes, as ſome Nectar, more precious then Malmſey: for it potently cocts frigid humours, moves expectoration, roborates the ſtomack, hinders crudities, helps concoction, moves appetite, diſcuſſes flatuoſity, mitigates cholical dolours, moves urine, and very much profits cold conſtitutions.</p>
                              <p>The Engliſh were wont to make a more compoſititious vinous Hydromel, which they called Metegla;
<note place="margin">Metegla.</note> which received leſs of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, but more Aromata and Leaven: which is thus confected.</p>

                              <p>Sape is made three wayes: for women make Sape of all kindes of Grapes injected into their Kettles, and cocted without water, and expreſſed and inſpiſſated into the conſiſtence of honey; and they call it <hi>Reſinetum,</hi> as if they would ſay, <hi>Racematum,</hi> that is, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited of bunches of Grapes.</p>

<note place="margin">Vires Salviae.</note> for many uſes, is made thereof; for by a ſpecial faculty, it roborates the Brain and Nerves, conduces much to trembling, ſtupour, palſey, and affections of the Brain. That which is made of Balm, gently helps the Memory: That which is made of the flowers called Stoechados, frees the Liver from obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and recreates the Brain.</p>
                                 <p>Many Pharmacopoliſts, it may be, have more Conſerves condited of flowers, and many fewer; and if any one be not content with theſe, he hath liberty to make Conſerves of Poeony, Tamarisks, Primroſe, and Succory, Some make Conſerve of Mallows flowers, which much conduces to the Stone, and vices in the Reins; for it le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niates, allayes heat, diduces the paſſages, and expels ſand from the Kidneys.</p>

                              <p>There is every-where great plenty and variety of Plums, whereof Damaſcens, white, black, red, and violaceous ones, are very expetible: but moſt of all, the Imperial Plums; which, when mature, are moſt grateful.</p>
                              <p>And theſe alſo, like other fruits, are condited for better preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and firſt they are decorticated, and preſently caſt into water, leſt they ſhould grow flave or black; and then they are cocted, till the ſyrupe of their ſucce, mixed with ſugar, be of a legitimate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence.</p>
                              <p>Thus may Peaches and ripe Apples be condited.</p>
                              <p>The Pills of Oranges and Lemmons, partly becauſe of their hardneſs, and partly of their inſuavity, are once or twice macerated in warm water before conditure; into which water at the firſt time, ſome inject a little bundle of aſhes; at the ſecond time, they are
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:37350:330"/>cocted in ſimple water, with an equal weight of ſugar, and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in their ſyrupe perfectly cocted.</p>
                              <p>But for ſuch as delight onely in dry confectures, they may be thus made: The Pills thus condited, muſt be taken; their ſyrupe wherewith they are madid, either gently deterged with a cloth, or lightly waſhed off with water.

                              <p>Quinces, becauſe of their ſolidity, endure much coction; and therefore they require more water. They ſhould be cocted, not onely till they be ſoft, but till their Syrupe be craſſer; wherein they muſt be kept whole, and not diſcepted, nor reducted to a Pulteſs.</p>
                              <p>Quinces may be condited another way; to wit, cocted with Sugar: and in cocting agitated, that they may acquire the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence of a Pulteſs; and then they muſt be removed, and repoſed in ligneous Boxes: if the weight of theſe Quinces and Sugar be equal, the conditure will be more ſuave, but leſs aſtrictive.</p>
                              <p>There is yet another conditure more red and lucid, made onely of the decoction of the Pills and ſeeds of Quinces, with an equal weight of Sugar, cocted to the conſiſtence of a Syrupe, and kept in Boxes of Pine-wood: if in cocting, the veſſel be ſhut and covered which contains them, the conditure will be more red; which co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour is moſt expetible in all conditures of Quinces. Some adde the ſucce of Quinces thereto, and call it clear Cidoniat.</p>
                              <p>There is alſo a Conſerve made of Quinces, but after another manner: for their ſucce is elicited, cocted and ſtrained, and twice as much ſugar added to the colature, and cocted to the conſiſtence of an Electuary; the ſucce is in equal weight mixed with ſugar, and ſo the Conſerve made of a red colour, grateful ſapour, and eximi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous faculties.</p>

                                 <p>Some Roots ſhould be condited onely in the Spring, before their ſucce be immitted into their branches, boughs and leaves; others in Autumn, when Plants demit their leaves; for then much of the Plants vertue goes into the Roots, and then the humour is more throughly cocted, then at other times: others may be condited, both in the Spring, Summer, and Autumn, being alwayes ſucculent, whoſe cauls are either not erupted, or grown up, or elſe dryed: They muſt then be collected in that feaſon, wherein their vertue is moſt prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent; as the Roots of Ragwort and Rainbow in the Spring; the Root of Poeony in <hi>Auguſt,</hi> according to <hi>Sylvius,</hi> or rather in <hi>March;</hi> the Roots of Enula, Bryony, and Maidens-graſs, in Autumn: as we have ſhewed at large in our Inſtitutions (<hi>Cap.</hi> 13. <hi>Lib.</hi> 1.)</p>
                                 <p>Some of them are amare, ſharp, and inſuave; which before their conditure, ſhould be often macerated in water: others are grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; which being one day infuſed in warm water, may in the ſame or another be cocted forthwith; as the Roots of Poeony, which may be well condited, according to this preſcribed form; or ſome other of the like ſort when they are cocted, and the Sugar cocted like a ſoft Electuary affunded upon them: if they become crude, the liquor muſt be again cocted, and that again repeated, till they ceaſe from their crudity.</p>

                                 <p>The Roots of Sea-holly being ſweet, needs undergo but one ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration before conditure; and then be cocted in the ſame water, till they be ſoft; then condited with Sugar, as the form ſhews. <hi>Meſue</hi> addes ſome Aromata's, as Cinamon, and Ginger, wherewith be would have the Roots ſtuck; and he boyls them with a portion of Honey and Sugar; or elſe Honey onely, thrice the quantity of the Roots. But the form I have exhibited, is more uſual, and better.</p>
                                 <p>We everywhere in the Aarabian writings, meet with <hi>Secacul,</hi> which is hitherto taken for Sea-holly: But its deſcription given by <hi>Avicenna</hi> and <hi>Serapio,</hi> ſhew, that it is another Plant, diſſimilar in face, if not faculties: It grows in <hi>India;</hi> and is there condited, and is kept, and given for venereous matters; as alſo our Sea-holly, which ſome do perperouſly call <hi>Secacul,</hi> though their vertues be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine: for both of them are hot and moiſt, in the end of the firſt, and beginning of the ſecond degree: They move Venery.</p>
                                 <p>Therefore they do right, who for defect of the <hi>Indian Secacul,</hi> ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiture our Sea-holly: and let ſuch ceaſe to be angry at this ſubſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who muſt have ſomething of that nature, and cannot get the true <hi>Secacul.</hi>

                                 <p>Sea-holly is of the kinde of aculeated Plants, whoſe leaves are tender, not ſpinous and rigid, and fit for cibaries. <hi>Dioſcorides</hi> ſaith, they are broad aſperated about their ambient, aromatical to the guſt, and when perfectly grown aculeated with many horrid ſpines.

                              <p>Some confect it with ſimple Hydroſa charum, that is, water and ſugar; others with ſugar ſolved, and cocted in Saxifrage water; and ſome that would have it more roborative, with Rob, or inſpiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſated ſucce of Myrtle, as <hi>Meſue</hi> adviſes. We confect it with ſyrupe of Roſes, or <hi>Alexanders</hi> ſyrupe; for ſo it is more grateful, then thoſe with Rob of Myrtle, and Hydroſacharum: yea, its faculty ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borates in a mean betwixt them.</p>
                              <pb n="551" facs="tcp:37350:334"/>
                              <p>But if it be kept for a Roborative, it may be rightly confected with ſyrupe of Myrtle: but Pharmacopoliſts do not now preſerve it.</p>
                              <p>Foxes Lungs ſhould, if poſſible, be onely taken by ſuch as are young, ſound, and given to hunting: they muſt be waſhed in wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, incided, according to the veſſels whereto they adhere, and wherein they are ſuſpended; their blood muſt be expreſſed; then moderately waſhed in white-wine, impoſed in a pot, dryed in an Oven pretty hot, and kept.</p>
                              <p>When uſe calls for them, a portion of them muſt be levigated very ſmall, and mixed with ſome idoneous liquor, as in this Eclegm, with the ſaid Syrupe, and other pulverated Medicaments.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>Meſue</hi> deſcribes this Lonoch of Foxes Lungs to difficult breathers;
<note place="margin">Vires.</note> but ſome would rather bray the Lung, and exhibit it mixed with Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lep of Roſes; others, upon good grounds, prefer the Lungs of other wholeſome Animals, as Hogs, Rams, or Calves Lungs, for the eaſure of ſuch as are troubled with difficulty of breathing: for the diſeaſed may eat theſe with more delight and ſalubrity, to the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of two or more ounces; and ſo better conſult the ſanity of his Lungs, then if he uſes an ounce of this Eclegm, wherein there is ſcarce a ſcruple of Foxes Lungs. Yet this ſhould be kept in Phar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macopolies, becauſe it is very bechical, and may be ſucceſsfully uſed by ſuch as are tabid.</p>

                              <p>That this Eclegm may be well confected, the root of Orris ſhould be cut into ſhort pieces, and be firſt cocted in limpid water by half a quarter of an hour; then muſt the ſeeds be injected; then the fruits and leaves; laſt the Liquorice and Cinamon: the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders being levigated, a part muſt be confuſedly mixed, and conjected into the colature, duly cocted with Penidees; that of theſe united and agitated with a Peſtel, may ariſe an Eclegm, which from its effect is called Sound and Expert: for it contains many fruits, ſeeds,
<pb n="552" facs="tcp:37350:335"/>leaves, and ſome gummes, which commonſtrate its eximious facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; whereunto they adde Amylum, to make it more viſcid.</p>
                              <p>Now Amylum may be made of many cereals; but the beſt is that, that is made of Wheat five times madefied with water, till it be ſoft: which done, the water is effuſed without agitation, leſt ſomething that is uſeful, flow out with it: when it is very ſoft, and the water effuſed, it ſhould be calcated with ones feet, and ſo bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; then ſhould water be again ſuperfuſed upon it, and it again calcated, and the enatant bran received into a ſieve, and the reſt dried in a Basket, and forthwith baked in the ſun, and kept. For thus it is grinded without a Mill, and thence called Amylum. It leniates ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſperated parts, ſtays the fluxions of the eyes, and rejections of Blood.</p>

We ſhall adde the manner and reaſon of their confecting, and the quality of the Confection: But we ſhall withall omit many Purges deſcribed by the Ancients, becauſe their uſe is not ſalubre, nor a due order obſerved in their Compoſition, as admitting of many noxious, uſeleſs, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known Medicaments. We ſhall alſo neglect many deſcribed and invented by late men; who, being covetous of vain-glory, cognominated ſome after their own Titles, and from a fictitious effect. We ſhall (I ſay) relinquiſh ſuch, and give onely the more ſelect, approved, and uſeful. We diſſect this Treatiſe into four Sections: In the firſt whereof we ſpeak of liquid Electuaries; in the third, of ſolid ones; in the fourth, of Pills; and in the ſecond, of bitter Confections, which Medicks call Hierae.</hi>

                           <p>The COMMENTARY.</p>
                           <p>All do not make Diacaſſia alike: for ſome coct the ſucces of Plants with honeys to a fit craſſitude, and then adject the Caſſia; others elixate the Plants, and in the colature dilute Caſſia and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; and then fervefie the whole mixture, to the conſiſtence of a liquid Electuary. But that manner wherein the Caſſia is ſo long cocted, is diſapproveable; but the other, whereby the Canes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Caſſia is contained, are waſhed in the ſtrained decoction, and afterwards a pound of honey added, and they cocted to a legitimate ſpiſſitude, that by the adjection of a pound of Caſſia, they may become an Electuary, is very good.</p>
                           <p>Some, in ſtead of honey, mix ſugar therewith; others, both: ſome adde Manna; others, Senny; others, other Medicaments: and ſo confect various Electuaries of Caſſia, whereunto I aſſent not. For it is enough, that we have Diacaſſia made according to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript for Glyſters; and if the pith of Caſſia muſt be aſſumed at the mouth, it may be extracted freſh, and taken alone, or mixed with other Medicaments, as the Medick requires.</p>
                           <p>But Aegyptian or Oriental Caſſia ſhould be ſelected, which is without redly black, and within full of a fat, medullous, and black matter; which is of force to contemperate heat, waſh the Belly, and gently purge the Body; and may thence be ſecurely given to Boyes, Old-men, and pregnant Women: for it ſubduces the Belly without moleſtation; but it is thought procurative of flatulency, and therefore many educe its pith in the vapour of cocted Aniſe or Fennel; others mix ſome Cinamon with it: and <hi>Coraeus</hi> gives it with ſome grains of Berberries, to ſuch as have weak Inteſtines.</p>
                           <p>I hear of a new kinde of Caſſia brought from <hi>Braſile;</hi> a half ounce whereof doth more move the Belly, and copiouſly educe hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, then a whole ounce of the vulgar and oriental.</p>
                           <p>Diacaſſia is a benign Medicament, and purges clemently: it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layes the heat of the Meſentery, gently moves the Belly, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mectates its ſiccity, and by lubrication and deterſion, depoſes the excrements by ſtool.</p>

                           <p>The Raiſins which ingrede this confection, ſhould be purged from their ſtones: if white Adiantum, or true Maidens-hair cannot be had, Polytrichum may be ſubſtituted in its ſtead. Conſerve of Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets, or Sugar of Violets, may be mixed at pleaſure. He that judges Conſerves inept in Electuaries, may adde Aniſe or ſweet Fennel-ſeed, or a little Cinamon: yet this Electuary hath hitherto been confected without any of them, and the uſers have not found any moleſtation from flatulency.</p>
                           <p>The fruits whoſe pulps muſt be educed, muſt be humectated in a part of the prepared decoction; another part thereof with ſugar muſt be made into a Syrupe, and the pulps with ſugar of Violets, mixed with it while hot: then muſt an ounce and an half, or at leaſt an ounce and three dragms of well-levigated Senny, be added to every pound of the Compoſition; whereof they ſay <hi>Rhaſis</hi> is Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor.</p>
                           <p>This lenitive Electuary, thus cognominated from its effect,
<note place="margin">Vires.</note> levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies, mollifies, and ſubduces the Belly; educes all obvious, but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially pituitous and melancholical humours, without moleſtation: it helps againſt the Pleuriſie, and other pectoral affections.</p>

                           <p>The COMMENTARY.</p>
                           <p>That this univerſal Antidote may be duly confected, many things muſt be brayed, and prepared apart; and firſt of all, Polypody, which being twice aſſumed, muſt be bifariouſly prepared. In the firſt courſe it muſt be brayed only pretty groſly; in the ſecond, it muſt be levigated very ſmall: that which is onely contunded, muſt be long cocted in the preſcribed, or ſufficient quantity of water; and a Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupe muſt be made of two parts of its colature and ſugar.</p>
                           <p>The Tamarinds and Caſſia muſt be humectated with the reſt, that their pulps may be more eaſily ſeparated and ſecerned.</p>
                           <p>The Rhabarb muſt be brayed alone; the Senny, Liquorice, Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, and Violets, both alone and together; twice as much of the Syrupe of Violets, may be mixed in ſtead of the Violets: the four cold ſeeds muſt be excorticated, and minutely cut with a Pen-knife; then muſt the Penidia and Sugar be pulverated; then muſt all be put together, and agitated with a ligneous Peſtel or Rudicle, till they become an Electuary of a legitimate conſiſtence.</p>
                           <p>And the compoſition of this ſolemn Medicament is not onely va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, but there are alſo various opinions concerning its Author: for <hi>Sylvius</hi> ſeems to aſcribe the invention thereof to <hi>Galen; Jouber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> to <hi>Nicolaus Myrepſicus; Bauderonius,</hi> to <hi>Nicolaus Salernitanus; Adolphus Occon,</hi> to <hi>Nicolaus Praepoſitus; Valer. Cordus,</hi> to <hi>Nicolaus Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xandrinus;</hi> who indeed hath deſcribed it, but not as it is vulgarly made.</p>
                           <p>But none know certainly, to which of theſe to attribute its inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: but all call it <hi>Nicolaus his Catholicum,</hi> not adding his Sirname.</p>
                           <p>Now this Medicament is called Catholical, or Univerſal, either becauſe it expurges all humours, or becauſe it draws them from all parts of the Body.</p>
                           <p>That which is made according to this preſcript, is called <hi>Simple Catholicum,</hi> in reference to the more compound; which receives twice as much Rhabarb and Senny; yet neither of them ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially, or in powder, ingrede that ſame, as they do this ſimple Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicum: but the Senny is cocted, and the Rhabarb infuſed, and its expreſſion joyned with the mixture; which formed into an Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary, is called <hi>Catholicum Duplicatum.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Many coct Aniſe and Fennel, and others Coriander-ſeed, with Polypody, to diſcuſs its flatuoſity: but there is Fennel enough in the deſcription, to effect this; ſo that there is no need to congeſt ſo many Medicaments of the ſame faculty together. If any like not Aniſe, he may in its ſtead ſubſtitute ſweet Fennel or Coriander, or an equal weight of each: yea, any may adde ſome Cinamon, to make it more grateful, and it will be of good conſequence. The reſt I leave to the old deſcription, which moſt Medicks approve of, and prefer before many purges: which to pervert, as <hi>Rondeletius</hi> hath done, were a piece of a piacle.</p>
                           <pb n="557" facs="tcp:37350:337"/>
                           <p>Some keep a certain Catholicum in their ſhops for Glyſters, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from the common one, onely in this, that it admits of one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly old and worſe Rhabarb, and is confected with Honey in ſtead of Sugar.</p>

                           <p>The deſcription of this Electuary, ſhews the manner of its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, which indeed is the beſt: though ſome make it otherwiſe, who waſh and elixate not onely the pulps of Plums and Tamarinds, but of Caſſia alſo, to the conſiſtence of Honey with a Syrupe: whereunto they afterwards adde the Powders, that, together with its deſired faculty, it may acquire its legitimate conſiſtence.</p>
                           <p>But all agree not about the quantity of Violets: for ſome, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Nic. Myrepſus</hi> his decree, take onely half an ounce, others
<pb n="558" facs="tcp:37350:338"/>an ounce and a half: we, aiming at the mean, take one ounce, to be a little cocted in the ſtrained decoction of the Plums. Some, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Authors intention, adde Cinamon; but we think it unfit for a lenitive and refrigerative Medicament.</p>
                           <p>And we judge no otherwiſe of Berberries-ſeeds, though we know that they are roborative: for Diaprunum may eaſily be without their help, ſeeing it admits of Rhabarb and Roſes, which are farre more roborative, and ſeeing its main faculty ſhould rather be leni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive then roborative.</p>
                           <p>But that they call Spodium, is not once to be thought of in this confection, becauſe the Grecian Spodium is noxious, and the Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bian cannot be had, and is withall inconvenient; as alſo Antiſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium, which being nothing but burnt Ivory, hath no affinity with the burnt Roots of Cane, which <hi>Avicenna</hi> calls Spodium: as we have ſhewed in our third Book of Medicinal Matter, <hi>Chap.</hi> 11.</p>

                           <p>Both the ſorts of Diaprunum are compounded and laxative, but the ſimple not admitting of Diacridium, ſubduces the Belly eaſily, ſcarce moving the firſt region of the Body: the other, which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting of Diagridium, moves the Belly potently, and deduces hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours from all parts, is called the more compound.</p>
                           <p>Onely one ounce of Diacridium, is added to each pound of the ſimple Diaprunum: ſo that one ounce of the Electuary, contains but one ſcruple of the ſame. <hi>Nic. Salernitanus</hi> doth perverſly aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the weight of the Diacridium, mixing ſeven dragms thereof, with each pound of the Electuary: for ſo its purgative faculty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes more efferous, and its uſe more unſafe. Diacridium muſt be levigated very ſmall, and put to the Electuary while hot.</p>
                           <p>This Diaprunum,

                           <p>The COMMENTARY.</p>
                           <p>Seeing Dates of a perfect magnitude, and not abſolutely mature, are ſomewhat flave, there is no need of this word <hi>Kirron</hi> in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript, which vulgar Apothecaries uſually adde: for if they derive it from the Greeks, it ſignifies flave; if from the Barbarians, who write it <hi>Kheyron,</hi> it ſignifies immature; or rather, as it is moſt cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible, <hi>Chayrum,</hi> a Town or Field where beſt Dates grow: which one <hi>Saladinus,</hi> a Triobolar writer, ſeems to avouch, when he ſaith, that <hi>Keiron</hi> is a Province of the Sarazens. Seeing there is no need to ſeek immature Dates for this confection, when mature ones will make it aſtrictive enough, and caſtigate Scammony: yet I think, That neither abſolutely immature, nor yet mature ones, but indifferent betwixt both, are beſt.</p>
                           <p>But before they ingrede the compoſition, they ſhould be purged from their pills and ſtones, cut into pieces, and macerated in a ſmall quantity of Vinegar, onely a day, if they be ſoft; if not, two or three, and that in an earthen pot; then muſt they be brayed in a Marble-Morter; then trajected through a cernicle, and afterwards elixated with deſpumed honey, till their vinegar be diſſipated.</p>
                           <p>Some macerate Dates in Hydromel, others in white-wine; but they are fitter to the temper of Aromata's, and attenuate Phlegm, which are macerated in vinegar.</p>
                           <p>The Penidia muſt be of Barley, which are made of Sugar and Barley-water, cocted to an idoneous craſſitude.</p>
                           <p>Turbith, Wood-Aloes, Galangal, Ginger, and other Simples, muſt be pulverated. Almorids muſt firſt be incided ſmall with a knife, and then levigated with Penidees; then all the Powders may be mixed together, except Scammony, which muſt be brayed apart, and laſt of all mixed with them; not to thrice as much Honey, as <hi>Cordus</hi> holds, but to half a pound.</p>
                           <p>For thus much honey, ſuffices the Dates, Penidia and Almonds being all ſweet; whoſe weight in all, is one pound, nine ounces and three dragms; the weight of the other Powders, eight ounces and ſix dragms: which put together, make two pounds and an half;
<pb n="560" facs="tcp:37350:339"/>which, with half a pound of deſpumed honey, conſtitutes three pounds, or thirty ſix ounces: ſo that for each ounce of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound, there is a ſcruple of Diacridium.</p>
                           <p>Perhaps this quantity of honey, may not to ſome ſeem copious enough to receive the Powders, nor juſt to bring the Electuary to a legitimate conſiſtence; eſpecially ſeeing <hi>Bauderonius,</hi> moſt perite in Pharmacy, takes thirteen ounces and an half of honey; <hi>Bern. Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſennius,</hi> two pounds; <hi>Joan. Coſta,</hi> two pounds and eight ounces; and <hi>Rondeletius,</hi> ſix pounds: But Dates, Penidia, and Almonds, ſupply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Honey's office, the quantity we have defined may be enough, which by augmentation makes the vertue of the compound more imbecile.</p>
                           <p>Some weigh the Dates after they are macerated in vinegar; others take (and that better) their weight according to <hi>Meſu's</hi> definition, before their maceration; and then infuſe, then bray and prepare them, as we have declared. This Medicament is denominated from them, as from its baſis: which yet ſome call Diaturbith, becauſe Turbith is moſt prepotent amongſt the Purgatives, which ingrede its compoſition; becauſe of which, this Medicament is Phlegma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogous.</p>
                           <p>Diaphoenicum,
<note place="margin">Vires.</note> or confection of Dates, doth clemently and ſafely purge phlegm and choler, cures Belly-ach, cholick, and all diſeaſes from crude and pituitous humours, diuturnal alſo, and pituitous Fevers.</p>

                           <p>The COMMENTARY.</p>
                           <p>Many commend this Medicament, when congeſted and compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; but few celebrate the Simples whereof it conſiſts; ſcarce two amongſt a hundred keep to one proportion, or make it after one manner: for, ſome augment, ſome detract, and many change the weight; but we, in the apparation of this Medicament, hold the words of no Authors for Oracles, but according to the dictate of Reaſon, change ſomewhat of that our Author preſcribed: For in ſtead of the ſucce of wilde Bugloſs, we ſubſtitute the ſucce of Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Bugloſs, or rather Borrage, as better; in ſtead of half an ounce of Senny, which could be of no remarkable potency, we put a whole ounce; in ſtead of three ounces and an half of Scammony, we onely admit of three, that each ſcruple thereof, might reſpond to each ounce of the compoſition: For we judge, that its purgative faculty will thus be valid enough. We do not inſtitute cocted Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cridium, to be recocted in a Quince, leſt its vertue be obtunded.</p>
                           <p>We have added Conſerve of Violets, that it might be more leni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive: we admit of onely half an ounce of Aſarabacca, in ſtead of <hi>Meſue</hi>'s four. But it may be that weight was changed by the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, miſtaking <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g> iiij. for ℥ iiij. Polytrichum may be ſubſtituted in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of Maidens-hair: the manner of preparation is apparent e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough in the deſcription.</p>
                           <p>Now if any admire why <hi>Meſue,</hi> deſigning a venenate quality to Fleawort, ſhould put it in ſo great quantity in this Medicament, whereof it is the Baſis: I anſwer, That that might happen to him, which many grave men have not avoided, to wit, to ſpeak ſomething precipitantly, which better thoughts, and further knowledge, might caſtigate and change: But however he thought, Fleawort is not deletery, and therefore accedes this Electuary, which is of much uſe.</p>
                           <p>This Electuary doth not onely temper, but purge choler,
<note place="margin">Vires.</note> helps in acute Fevers, and all hot and dangerous diſeaſes, cures the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigo, and all ſuch capital affections as proceed from the aſcent or congeſtion of hot humours, and helps the hot or obſtructed Liver, and other affections flowing from that fountain.</p>

                           <p>Their opinion muſt be rejected, who think that Diagridium muſt either be leſſened in quantity, or quite ſubſtracted, leſt the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cament become too Cholagogous: for there concurring three Phlegmagogous Purgatives, this quantity is well defined, both to excite the ſlow faculty of Turbith, and to purge ſome choler with the phlegm.</p>

                           <p>The COMMENTARY.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Fernelius</hi> hath well caſtigated and changed this Electuary, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving its vertue entire, and reducing its deſcription into an eaſier form: for, as <hi>Plantius</hi> ſaith, Myrobolambs twice decocted, and then brayed and impoſed, are fruſtraneous. Rhabarbs faculty pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes
<pb n="563" facs="tcp:37350:340"/>by coction; Caſſia, Manna, and Tamarinds, by coction corrupt: Diagridium alſo, when cocted, is without vertue, nor ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily commiſcible: and yet by <hi>Meſue</hi>'s ancient deſcription, theſe were all thus prepared, and confuſedly mixed, without art or order. Wherefore we have extracted this deſcription from <hi>Fernelius,</hi> as being much better when made, and much caſier to make, without which, no Pharmacopoly ſhould be once found: And notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this ſame Rhythmical admonition of a certain Verſifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor:
<q>Non eris illuſus, teneas ſi quod tenet uſus.</q> When the uſe is prave, it muſt be changed; and that mutation is good, which is from good to better.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Meſue</hi> requires to this confection, the Whey of Goats-milk, but defines not how much: yet we may aſſume the Whey of Aſſes milk in its ſtead; and if that be wanting, of Cows-milk: in two pounds whereof, the Simples muſt be macerated and cocted, and they will depoſe their faculties therein. The pulps of Raiſins and Plums muſt be diſſolved in the colature; the Honey, Sugar and ſucce of Fumatory, muſt be all cocted therein, above the conſiſtence of a Syrupe: the reſt muſt be added as the deſcription ſhews; it is eaſie enough.</p>
                           <p>This confection purges both the Biles, and ſalt phlegm;
<note place="margin">Vires.</note> and thence conduces to the Canker, Leproſie, Raving, Melancholy, Tet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Itch, Scab, and ſuch cutaneous affections.</p>
                           <p>Barber-Chirurgeons uſe this, to purge all ſuch as are infected with the French diſeaſe; as though all had one temper, and but one humour peccant in all men. But ſuch of them as boaſt more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly, and are by conference with Medicks ſomething more pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, acknowledge the matter peccant in this diſeaſe, to be various, according to the various natures of the diſeaſed.</p>

<pb n="564" facs="tcp:37350:341"/>incommendable in faculties, I exhibit one indued with all theſe dowries; for its ſapour is very grateful, its colour pleaſant, and its faculties eximious, and eaſily tolerable, by ſuch as need them.</p>
                           <p>We leave out Ginger, which was wont to be added to Turbith, becauſe we have accumulated many Aromata's, to caſtigate its ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, which are more ſweet and cordial; which alſo abate of the fury of Diagridium, eſpecially Roſes, Violets, and Santals, which allay alſo the heat of the Aromata's: Penidia are added for miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, Sugar for ſuavity, and Honey for conſervation.</p>

                           <p>It is moſt commodious to ſuch who abound with many bilious and pituitous excrements, and can take no purgative Medicaments, but grateful ones: for this confection is not inſuave, and yet it potently ſubduces the Belly, removes obſtructions, purges craſs and viſeid humours, helps compounded Fevers, and all ſuch diſeaſes as ariſe from phlegm and bile: But it is not ſo good in the heat of Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, unleſs it be drunk in ſome validly-refrigerative decoction, or other ſuch liquor.</p>

                           <p>Each diſeaſe hath its praeſidy, but every Diſpenſatory ſuppedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates
<pb n="565" facs="tcp:37350:341"/>not a Salve for every ſore: We ſhall endeavour now to adde ſomething, wherein many have been defective, and afford an auxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liary for the Hypochondriacal; who, as yet, have been either over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looked, or taken for deſperate. This Medicament is concinnated for the affections of the Hypochondriacal, Hiſterical, Melancholical, and ſuch as venery hath proclaimed French-men. It is named <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lalzemer,</hi> from Senny its Baſis, which the Arabians call <hi>Albazemer;</hi> then which, no Medicament is more melanagogous, nor purge more tolerable. This we mix partly in Powder, partly in infuſion, with ſuch things as diſcuſs flatulency, attenuate humours, remove infar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, roborate the ſpleen, liver, and bowels, recreate the facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, reſpect the Uterus, obtund ſome malign quality, and ſecurely propel humours long ſince congeſted; not onely melancholical and contumacious ones, but viſcid and pituitous alſo, which ſometimes put on the habit of Melancholly, and ſome aduſt bilious humours: and therefore we adde Rhabarb and Turbith, that we may with the Melancholical Captain-humour, educe the Pituitous, his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion inſeparable, and alſo the Bilious, which is pediſſequous.</p>
                           <p>And becauſe this Medicament moſt reſpects melancholy, we have ſelected black Hellebore for this black humour; rejecting the white, as more convenient for Phlegm.</p>
                           <p>The manner of its preparation is eaſie, and ſufficiently demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated in the deſcription. But before all be congeſted into the compoſition, the Azure-ſtone calls for ſome preparation; as thus:</p>
                           <p>A ſufficient quantity thereof muſt be taken, brayed in a Metal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line Morter, waſhed with common water, dryed in the Sun or hot aſhes; then again waſhed and dryed; and ſo again, and again, till the water remain limpid; then muſt it be dryed, and that not ten, but, if need be, twenty times; then let it be waſhed four, five, or more times in cordial waters; then let it be dryed, and kept for uſe. For thus its malign quality periſhes, and its purgative e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vades conqueror. In the confection of Alkermes it is burnt, and its purgative faculty exhaled, its cordial onely then remaining, whereof there is uſe.</p>
                           <p>Diabalzemer doth miraculouſſy help the Splenical,
<note place="margin">Vires.</note> Melancholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, Hypochondriacal, Maniacal, Epileptical, Hiſterical, and Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phantical: This frees Widows from their foetid colours for want of concourſe; and venereous Indians from their ſcarlet Noſes, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted by contract.</p>

                           <p>Many deſcriptions we have, which ſmell more of confuſion, then compoſition, whoſe effects ſhew their brangling Authors; and therefore we reject many liquid Electuaries, as either unaccommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated for cure, by their ill compoſure; or obſolete, for want of cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome; picking out ſuch as are better deſcribed, and more appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by their ſanative effects: As, beſides the two former which we have added, this alſo, which for its excellence is called, The eximi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Hydragogal Electuary, which we deſire may be alwayes in Pharmacopolies, that it may be ready to open the ſluce when the river is ſtopped, and the banks almoſt over-run; leſt the hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>droptical be without praeſidy, and drown his vitals in his watty Belly. And becauſe we would have this Medicament perfect, we have added ſuch things as will emend the diſtemper, remove the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, and roborate the whole of the Spleen and Liver, from which the hydroptical get much of his evil. We have alſo added ſome, to diſcuſs flatuoſity, and awaken the native calour; Beſides many more, which duly prepared, become hydragogous. The form demonſtrates the manner of their preparation.</p>
                           <p>This may be ſafely given to ſuch as labour under the Dropſie;
<note place="margin">Vires.</note> for it educes watry humours without violence; and is a moſt accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate Purgative for all diſeaſes ariſing from thence.</p>

                              <p>This <hi>Hiera</hi> is, by <hi>Galen</hi> its Author, called <hi>Picra,</hi> that is, amare, becauſe of the Aloes, which is its Baſis; from which it mutuates its Purgative faculty. We retain the old compoſition, ſave that in ſtead of Xylobalſum, which is ſcarce to be had, we, by <hi>Fernelius</hi> his advice, ſubſtitute Mace; and for the flowers of the ſweet Ruſh, which are not brought to us, the Ruſh it ſelf: and ſo we keep to the quantity which <hi>Galen,</hi> or rather <hi>Andromachus,</hi> preſcribed to be mixed with the Aloes.</p>
                              <p>This <hi>Hiera Picra</hi> was moſt uſual at <hi>Rome;</hi> beſides other two, which <hi>Galen</hi> ſometimes uſed; in which he detracted, changed, or at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure added what exigence called for. But now they are obſolete.</p>

                              <p>The COMMENTARY.</p>
                              <p>This Hierae conſiſts of two benign purgative Medicaments; the one Aloes, which is Cholagogous; the other Agarick, which is Phlegmagogous: For two humours might be too hard for one Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicament; therefore to a mixt diſtemper, we preſcribe a mixt cure, or a compound of mixt qualities. And becauſe <hi>Galens</hi> Hiera Picra is often given to the affections of the Ventricle and Brain, wherein much of craſs phlegm lodges, as well as Bile, we have deſcribed this Hiera with Agarick, that it may expurge all at once. It is made as the precedent, whoſe powder is often kept in Pharmacopolies, and when uſe requires, mixt with Aloes and Honey, or with Aloes, Honey, and Agarick, as the Medicks ſcope requires.</p>
                              <p>But that which admits of Agarick,
<note place="margin">Vires.</note> is uſeful to many things: for it educes all, but chiefly craſs and viſcid phlegm, and putrid Bile; it incides humours, takes away infarctures, exonerates the Meſentery, purges the ventricle, reſarciates the appetite, helps coction, educes noxious humours from the brain, and cures the Epilepſie, Vertigo and Viligance.</p>

                              <p>In the Apothecaries Diſpenſatories, nothing is more confounded, then the deſcriptions of <hi>Hierae,</hi> which every one arbitrarily either changes, or denominates wrong. Hence we ſee the ſame <hi>Hiera</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned by three names; as that ſame which is ſometimes called the Hiera of <hi>Pacchius,</hi> ſometimes the Hiera of <hi>Archigenus,</hi> ſometimes of <hi>Ruffius,</hi> and ſometimes alſo of <hi>Diacolocynthis:</hi> and three different Hiera's deſigned by one name; as this of <hi>Diacolocynthis,</hi> which <hi>Meſue</hi> deſcribes one way, <hi>Nic. Myrepſus</hi> another, and <hi>Fernelius</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But we prefer the Hiera of <hi>Pacchius</hi> before them all, which we call Magiſterial, becauſe of the excellency of its Baſis and faculties. He that hath this, may eaſily be without all the Hiera's which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of Coloquintida; and it is thus made:</p>
                              <p>Opoponax, Bdellium, and Sagapenum, muſt be macerated a
<pb n="570" facs="tcp:37350:344"/>whole night, or elſe a day, in Vinegar, rather then in Wine, becauſe of the heat of thoſe ſimples which ingrede its compoſition: then they muſt be well ſtrained, and the Vinegar reſolved upon aſhes; the Purgatives muſt be brayed apart, and a little Oyl of Almonds put to the Coloquintida, leſt it moleſt the Brayer; then the other ſimples, the hardeſt firſt, the Aromata next, all muſt be mixed with deſpumed honey to a legitimate ſpiſſitude.</p>
                              <p>It is of eximious power,
<note place="margin">Vires.</note> in curing the affections of the head, ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle, and abdomen; which proceed from crude, pituitous, craſs, or melancholical humours; but eſpecially ſanative of the Apoplexy, Drowzineſs, Lethargy, Palſey, Epilepſie, Incubus, difficulty of Breathing, Cholick, Hypochondriacal Melancholy, and all affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Belly ariſing from vitreous and craſs phlegm, and all ſuch as ſtupifie the ſenſes, or hebeſcate motion, or both.</p>

                              <p>The COMMENTARY.</p>
                              <p>The deſcription of Diacarthamum is as much controverted, as it is uſed; which you ſhall ſcarce finde alike in two Authors. <hi>Jouber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> deſcribes it three manner of wayes; but Uſe and Reaſon aſſure us, that one of them is more certain ſafe, which we have bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed from <hi>Nic. Praepoſitus,</hi> which is ſomewhat changed from that which its Author <hi>Arnaldus Villanovinus</hi> gave of it.</p>
                              <p>It takes its name from <hi>Carthamus,</hi> which is its Baſis; though Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bith in plenty and faculties exceed it: Both their qualities are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by the adjection of Ginger. Diagridium and Hermoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctyls do not onely draw phlegm, but bile alſo from the articles; their efferous quality is caſtigated by condited Quinces fleſh: Manna, Diatragacanthum and Sugar, are put to leniate and temper, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terge and move phlegm, and Honey to conſerve.</p>
                              <p>Diacarthamum muſt be thus prepared: The ſeed of Carthamus muſt firſt be decorticated, then brayed; afterwards Ginger, Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bith, and Hermodactyls muſt be pulverated; then Diagridium, and Candid Sugar, and Quinces, the Honey, Manna, and Cidoniatum muſt be then mixt with the Sugar, cocted to the conſiſtence of a Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupe whilſt hot, and afterwards the powders, that they make a ſolid Electuary, to be diſcinded into tabels.</p>
                              <p>It is of frequent uſe,
<note place="margin">Vires.</note> and is kept ready almoſt in all Pharmacopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies: it purges pituitous humours potently, not onely from the ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle and Meſentery, but alſo from more remote parts: if it be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed in greater quantity, it detracts alſo ſomething of Bile: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it helps not onely in quotidian, and meerly pituitous Fevers, but in complicated alſo; which ariſe from the mixture of divers humors.</p>

                              <p>The COMMENTARY.</p>
                              <p>I am not he, who for oſtentation would change the old, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgate new ſentences, but to paſs my judgement on ſuch things as are ſpoken or written without reaſon: and here I challenge liberty to Philoſophize.</p>
                              <p>And now I ſeeing this Electuary deſcribed by <hi>Myrepſus,</hi> diſcerpt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from <hi>Salernitanus,</hi> variouſly patched, and ill concinnated by the more recent; I feared not to diminiſh the too heavy weight, aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the too light, and change the inept things: All which I did with conſultation, not precipitantly; I ſeeing no reaſon that the ſucce of Roſes ſhould be of equal weight with the Sugar, I diminiſh the quantity of the ſucce, and augment the Sugar; well knowing, that a pound of Sugar will ſooner and better be cocted to the conſiſtence of a Syrupe, or an Electuary, in half a pound of Roſes ſucce, then in a whole one; and its faculties will not be much more imbecile, but roborative enough.</p>
                              <p>Something alſo I have detracted from the weight of the Santals, and have ſubſtituted a little of the Pill of Oranges in its ſtead; part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to conciliate more ſuavity, and partly to arceate putretude, and recreate the vitals. Some leave out Camphyre, becauſe of its ſtrong ſent: but I approve of it; for its halite quality makes the Electuary more grateful, and its permeative quality more efficacious.</p>
                              <p>I have, in ſtead of Spodium, which cannot be had, Antiſpodium, which being onely burnt Ivory, is not proper, ſubſtituted Maſtick, to roborate the Ventricle, and caſtigate Scammony.</p>
                              <p>Burnt Ivory is fooliſhly and ineptly called Spodium, and ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted for the fictitious Arabian Spodium: for, let Apothecaries be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve as they will, there is but one true Spodium, and that is the Graecian Pompholix, which ſhould never be introſumed. The Arabian Interpreters are alſo miſerably out, in rendring <hi>Tabaxir</hi> Spodium, and Spodium Burnt Ivory: for <hi>Tabaxir</hi> is the ſucce or concreted liquor of certain Trees, or very craſs and tall Reeds, which by the agitation of the wind, and their mutual colliſion, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times conflagrate; from which burning, <hi>Avicenna</hi> mendicated his Spodium, or rather Tabaxir, which his infidous Interpreter <hi>Cluſius</hi> calls his Spodium. But we get not this Tabaxir from <hi>India,</hi> nor the aſhes of theſe burnt Canes from <hi>Arabia;</hi> neither would they be of much uſe in Medicine, if we had them: nor yet doth burnt Ivory reſpond to them as a ſubſtitute; therefore they muſt either be quite expunged, or ſome other congruous Medicament placed in their ſtead.</p>
                              <p>In the vulgar deſcription, there are ℈ xxxvj. of Diagridium, for each ounce of the compoſition: But in our emendation, there ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedes onely half a dragm of Diagridium, to each ounce of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound; and yet it is ſo valid and potent, that it may well retain its old name, The ſpur of Purgatives; for, in a ſmall mole, it hath much of efficacy.</p>
                              <pb n="573" facs="tcp:37350:345"/>
                              <p>The manner of its preparation, is the ſame with Diacarthamum, and that is apparent enough, by the deſcription of the form: ſome take onely the diſtilled ſucce of Roſes, wherein they macerate their Tragacanthum, and extract a Mucago for the comprehenſion of the Powders, and the concinnation of their ſolid Electuary. But I had rather inſpiſſate the ſucce in S. <hi>Maries</hi> Bath, to the ſpiſſitude of a Rob, that ſo it might better concorporate the Powders. If any will uſe unprepared Scammony for Diagridium, he may upon good grounds leave the wonted quantity of Roſes ſucce.</p>

                              <p>The COMMENTARY.</p>
                              <p>This laxative Electuary of Oranges, is a Catholical, or Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Cathartick: for it draws both the Biles and Phlegm potently, and without moleſtation; eſpecially that which we deſcribed firſt: wherein every Purgative hath its caſtigator, as Senny, Fennel, Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bith, Ginger, Diagridium, condite Orange-Pill, Conſerves, and Roſe-water, wherein the Sugar is cocted: All which roborate the heart and faculties, and mitigate the ſaid Purgatives. The Powder of Diatragacanthum is put in to leniate, the Sugar to deterge, leni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate, and conſerve.</p>
                              <p>VVe have alſo added four times the quantity of Orange-Pill, both becauſe it is its baſis, and becauſe it recreates the principal parts of the body. VVe alſo thought good to augment the quantity of Diagridium, to bear ſome proportion with the reſt: otherwiſe, its Purgative faculty being already imbecile, would be made more
<pb n="574" facs="tcp:37350:346"/>impotent by the increment of the Conſerves: the Baſis then of the Medicament, the roboratives, purgatives, and caſtigatories being by us rightly deſcribed, the whole, as amended, may be of moſt ſafe, eaſie, and approved uſe.</p>
                              <p>The Sugar ſhould be cocted a little below the conſiſtence of a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid Electuary, becauſe of the quantity of powders.</p>
                              <p>It is of very much uſe: for it much conduces in tertian and ſemitertain Agues; purges the ſtomack, expels the prave hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours abiding in the Hypochondria; takes away loathſomneſs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards meat, emends the ill diſpoſition of the body, roborates the heart and ventricle, and abſumes the excrementitious humidity of the bowels.</p>
                              <p>VVe purpoſe in our next book, to treat of Trochisks, which are all roborative, or alliotical, or alterative; ſave ſome few, which are purgative: of which, our method leads us to treat briefly in this Section.</p>

                              <p>Few ſuch Paſtils are kept in Pharmacopolies, ſeeing when uſe calls for them, Medicks can take ſome Rhabarb, and mix it with ſimples fit for their purpoſe: but prudent Apothecaries, who are not given to avarice, will not want ſuch; whoſe uſe is ſalutary, and deſcription good.</p>
                              <p>But that they may be duly made, the Rhabarb and Folesfoot muſt firſt be brayed ſmall, that they may better pervade the Liver, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fractures of the Meſentery, and the paſſages of the Uterus and Reins: The reſt muſt alſo be pulverated very ſmall, and made into a maſs, with a ſufficient quantity of the ſucce of Egrimony, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of Trochisks of any figure may be formed. If the definite quantity of Egrimonies ſucce be not ſufficient for the receipt of the powders, it may be augmented, that all may be better ſubacted; and the Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chisks, when concinnated, muſt be dryed and kept.</p>
                              <p>Trochisks of Rhabarb are good againſt the cold and bilious af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,

                              <p>Agarick is variouſly prepared by <hi>Meſue,</hi> with ſweet Wine, with Oxymel of Squills, with gemmeous Salt, with Whey of Milk, with Carrets, and other ſimples.</p>

Ginger alſo, by the tenuity of its parts, cauſes perviation; for the Agarick, by its heat, helps pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, and by its aromaticity, recreates the Ventricle, heart, and noble parts; as Wine alſo, which by its ponderous ſubſtance cohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits the levity of the Agarick: by reaſon whereof, it delabes ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the bottom of the Ventricle; and the ſupernatant is ſometimes ſolely excluded with humours.</p>

                              <p>Trochisks of Coloquintida or Alhandal, as the Arabians have, may be with ſucceſs injected into all compoſitions which receive Coloquintida; for this cannot be aſſumed ſimply, and uncaſtigated, without moleſtation; but formed into Trochisks, and concinnated with others, with ſafety: for thus prepared, it ingredes the compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fition of other Medicaments, whoſe faculties it acuates, and makes them educe phlegm, and other craſs and viſcid humours more potently.</p>
                              <p>But that theſe Trochisks may be right made, the whiteſt and light pulp of Coloquintida muſt be ſelected, and not onely incided, but pulverated ſmall: being craſs, and introſumed, it moves the Dyſentery, and abrades the inteſtines from ſuch portions as are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in its gyres and anfractures. <hi>Meſue</hi> in his old Book pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes onely <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g> x. of the pulp of Coloquintida; but the place is ſuſpected for erroneous, and <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g> x. put for ℥ x. for otherwiſe the quantity of Bdellium, and other Gummes, of each whereof he hath put <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g> ij. muſt be leſſened; which is no more then ſufficient for ten ounces.</p>

                              <p>All Pills which receive of Purgatives onely Aloes, or Aloes and Rhabarb, being clement, and drawing humours onely from the firſt region, and helping the ſtomack, are called Stomachical, or Pills before meat; becauſe they may at any time, a little before meat, be ſafely taken: of which ſort are thoſe Aloes in the ſucce of Roſes, coacted into a maſs with Wine; as alſo thoſe of <hi>Scaliger, Ruffus,</hi> and Pills of Hiera. But theſe we have given, being moſt uſual, and eaſie to make, may ſerve for a rule, for all ſtomachical Pills that ſhould be kept in Pharmacopolies: but they ſhould be made onely in ſmall quantity, that they may be alwayes new and freſh; for by long keeping they become too dry, and their faculties duller. The maſs muſt be involved in a piece of Leather well oyled, and then repoſed in a Tin-pot well ſhut.</p>
                              <p>All Pills and other Purges ſhould be given on an empty ſtomack, eſpecially ſuch as ſhould draw noxious humours from remoter parts, which may be aſſumed long before or after meat, as after the firſt ſleep; but ſtomachical Pills not ſo: for it is enough that they be taken one hour before break-faſt, or other meals, that the Belly may be gently ſubduced, and phlegm, or other prave humours, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Ventricle, or other vicine parts, be educed,

                              <p>The COMMENTARY.</p>
                              <p>There is ſcarce any Medicament, but it is by ſome changed from that it was by its Author at firſt made. Theſe Pills are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded by few, but variouſly changed by many: for ſome adde a third part of Myrrhe, others a fourth, and ſome onely an eighth: ſome mix Saffron and Myrrhe in equal weight; others take onely half as much Saffron as Myrrhe, and half as much Myrrhe as Aloes: according to which opinion, moſt famous Medicks pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe, and we have formed our deſcription.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>Rondeletius</hi> denies, that <hi>Ruffus</hi> was the Inventor of theſe Pills; for he tradited a Potion, rather then Pills, as <hi>Paulus Aegineta</hi> evidences. He indeed deſcribed a certain Medicament of Aloes, Myrrhe, and Ammoniacum Storax, brayed in odorate Wine, which he calls a Potion: yet he exhibits it in the magnitude of a Bean, which concords not with potulent meaſures, but an uſual expreſſion for the quantity of ſolid things. And hence the later age, upon good grounds, pronounces <hi>Ruffus</hi> the Author of theſe Pills. VVe ſubſtitute generous Oinomel, in ſtead of aromatical VVine, for the reception of the Powders, which is more conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient; for if they ſhould be ſubacted onely with VVine, the maſs would acquire a ſtony hardneſs. Syrupe of VVormwood is alſo a fit recipient for them.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>Ruffus</hi> his Pills are called Peſtilential,

                              <p>The deſcription we have here given, is more uſual and ſafe; whereunto, if you adde a little Diamoſchum, they will be Pills of Aloes, according to the vulgar edition: But the Agarick ſhould be firſt brayed; as alſo the Aloes and Maſtick, and ſubacted with Hydromel, rather then with Wine, both for efficacy and conſervation.</p>

They act perperouſly, who following <hi>Meſue</hi>'s advice, put the Powders into water of Endive, and ſo coact them into a maſs.</p>

Their denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation being noted by a certain circumlocution, ſhew the efficacy and neceſſity of their uſe, which no man, or Maſter of a Family, that mindes his ſanity, ſhould be without. Their ingredients are ſuch as deduce humours from all principal parts of the Body, and roborate thoſe parts. Rheubarb is their Baſis, if we reſpect their better part; Scammony, if their more valid and exuperant; and Myrabolambs, if the weight of fruits.</p>
                              <p>That they may be duly made, Scammony, Aloes, Agarick, and Maſtick ſhould be pulverated apart; the reſt partly alone, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly together.

                                 <hi>Nic. Praepoſitus</hi> doth juſtly inſult over <hi>Nic.

However, uſe hath ſo prevailed, that they are made according to the manner deſcribed: yet with this rule, That they be exhibited in a juſt and idoneous weight, according to the Medicks prudence, and diſeaſed's ſtrength; to whom, if four or five grains of Diagridium would purge him, ſo much of theſe Pills muſt be given, as receives juſt ſo much Diagridium.</p>

                                 <hi>Nic. Praepoſitus</hi> did well in the adjection of Maſtick, for the robo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Ventricle, againſt the attact of ſuch violent Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives. Tragacanthum is alſo juſtly commixed, to mitigate the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Scammony: but the Trochisks of Alhandal were ſafer, then Coloquintida uncaſtigated; all muſt be pulverated ſmall, and coacted into a maſs of a legitimate conſiſtence, with Honey of Roſes: for ſo it will be ſofter, then if it had been ſubacted with the diſſolved Gumme of Tragacantha.</p>
                              <p>They are called Golden Pills, rather from their croceous colour, then their excellent effect: for all Medicaments which potently ſubduce the Belly, and validly expurge humours, are not preſently denominated aureous or eximious, but ſuch onely as with facility, and without moleſtation, extract noxious ones.</p>
                              <p>Golden Pills are very cholagogous;
<note place="margin">Vires.</note> for they potently draw Bile and Phlegm alſo, not onely from the inferiour, but alſo ſuperiour Ventricle, and the head; and thence they purge the ſenſes, and acuate the eye-ſight.</p>

Joubertus</hi> diſapproves of it, but gives no reaſon. I think it is neither hurtful, nor greatly profitable: for if it be exploded, the Ventricle cannot want robo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratives, as long as Hiera, Myrrhe, Sape, and Orris, ingrede the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound: if it be admitted, it will neither obtund the faculties of the other, nor much better them.</p>
                              <p>Their firſt Author was <hi>Avicenna,</hi> who deſcribed them with Myrrhe; which <hi>Meſue</hi> omits, as <hi>Bauderonius</hi> obſerves in his Book, where he deſcribes Agarick and Coloquintida, without any expreſs preparation: But it is beſt to take them both, when made into Trochisks, and ſo bray and mix them.

                                 </gap>, but becauſe they are round and ſmall like Pepper-corns; after which manner, all Pills were wont to be made: and though they be now greater, yet we give them the ſame name, as well as the ſame deſcription. Some think them exceſſively purgative, becauſe of the greater quantity of Diagridium. And ſeeing Pharmacopoliſts ſhould have gentle purges for ſuch as are delicate, and valid ones for the ſtronger; I would have made them as <hi>Rhaſis</hi> hath deſcribed them; for they may be given in ſuch ſmall quantity, that they will not over-purge the Belly, but educe onely noxious humours.</p>
                              <pb n="584" facs="tcp:37350:351"/>
                              <p>Some doubt in their mixtion, whether <hi>Galens Hiera Picra</hi> ſhould be taken, or ſome other made: We, for many reaſons, which for brevities ſake we omit, judge no other Hiera more convenient, valid, or better: but it is ſafer to admit the Trochisks of Alhandal, then Coloquintida, unprepared; and if Syrupe of Stoechas be not in readineſs, which indeed few keep; then the Powders may be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted in Honey, with the decoction of Stoechas deſpumed, and coct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the conſumption of its a queous humidity. They are made as the precedents.</p>
                              <p>Theſe Pills purge partly bilious,
<note place="margin">Vires.</note> partly pituitous humours; not onely from the head, becauſe of Stoechas, which is more hepatical then cephalical; but alſo from other parts, wherein ſuch humours are contained, for they potently educe them from any part.</p>

                              <p>For their due preparation, Sagapenum and Opoponax muſt be melted in the ſucce of Coleworts; then tranſmitted through a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen cloth, and then a little cocted; then muſt the Powders of other ſimples be mixed in the ſucce cocted with Honey; and all brayed, ſubacted, and handled by hands anointed with oyl together, till they acquire a due conſiſtence: They may alſo be rightly ſubacted with the Eclegm of Cauls.</p>

                              <p>We hold to the ancient deſcription of <hi>Meſue,</hi> and change onely the order of the Simples, and ſubſtitute the Syrupe of Roſes, for the ſubaction of the compoſition, in ſtead of the Electuary of Roſes.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>Meſue</hi> gives three deſcriptions of Pills of this name; the firſt whereof is moſt uſual, and prepared almoſt in all Shops; the other two, both greater and leſſer agregatives, are omitted. They are called agregative Pills, becauſe of the agregation of many facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; as alſo Polychreſtae, and Catholical, becauſe they are of much uſe, and expurge all humours.</p>
                              <p>The manner of their mixtion is manifeſt; the roots muſt be firſt brayed, then the fruits, and afterwards the ſeeds; onely Rhabarb and Agarick muſt be prepared apart, the Trochisks whereof are bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then the ſimple. The ſucce of Egrimony and Wormwood dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and brayed, muſt be added thereunto; then all being duly pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verated, muſt be ſubacted into a maſs, with the Syrupe of pale Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, which muſt be involved in leather madefied with Oyl of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds. And it is not unreaſonable, that the Powders ſhould be received in the Syrupe of pale Roſes; partly, becauſe it accedes neareſt the minde of the Author, for nothing is liker Roſes then Roſes; and partly, becauſe that Electuary of Roſes, which <hi>Meſue</hi> mentions, is not now made in ſhops, ſeeing its compoſition is inept, and of no uſe.</p>
                              <p>Agregative Pills are not onely conducible to many affections of the head, but alſo of the Ventricle and Liver:
<note place="margin">Vires.</note> for from theſe parts they detract and purge pituity, Bile, and Melancholical ſucce; and therefore help in complex and inveterate Fevers, and complicated diſeaſes. He may be without the Pills of eight things, and five kindes of Myrabolambs, that hath agregative ones.</p>

                              <p>Theſe Pills are denominated from Fumatory, in whoſe ſucce their Powders muſt be twice or thrice imbuted, and then dryed as oft, according to their Authors preſcript; and at length received, not into the ſame ſucce, as many ignorantly conjecture, but into honey, wherein this ſucce hath been by longer coction diſſipated, or rather into the Syrupe of Fumatory, which is better, and more agreeable to the Authors minde: For unleſs the maſs be ſubacted in the one of theſe, or ſuch a like liquor, the powders will ſoon arefie.

                              <p>Theſe Pills are alſo deſumed from <hi>Avicenna,</hi> who calls them ſometimes <hi>Aſahajaret,</hi> ſometimes <hi>Sejar;</hi> and preſcribes them partly to the head, partly to the ventricle: but they draw little from parts more remote, ſeeing they admit not of ſuch things as potently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce cold humours.</p>
                              <p>The powder of <hi>Galens Hiera Picra</hi> muſt be deſumed to their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and not <hi>Hiera</hi> in form of an Electuary: The Myrabolambs may be purged from their ſtones, and brayed apart; then <hi>Chian</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick, then the Aloes; all muſt be received in the Syrupe of Stoechas, and made into a maſs.</p>
                              <p>Theſe Pills are indeed chalagogous, and much profit the impure and languid ventricle; and by conſequence, benefit the head, and cure ſuch affections as ariſe from ſome ſympathy with the ſtomack, and loweſt ventricle.</p>

                              <p>We retain a great part of the materials of ſweet Pills deſcribed by <hi>Meſue:</hi> but we have added Galangal, as moſt convenient, and detracted the moſt rare and dear ingredients, as Carpo-balſamum, Xylo-aloes, Cubebs, and the uſeleſs ones, as Aſarum. We do not allow of Aloes waſhed in rain-water, becauſe it makes it imbecile: neither do we approve of the quantity of Aromata's and water, wherein they ſhould be cocted, as defined by <hi>Meſue:</hi> for ſeeing Aro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mata's endure not coction, without the loſs of their vertues; what need is there of cocting them in twelve pounds of water, to the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of ſeven pounds thereof?

                              <p>In this our deſcription, we have the faculties and vertues of the third part of the Aromata's, better then we ſhould have them out of the whole deſigned by <hi>Meſue,</hi> and confected after his rite, who with the abſumption of the water, abſumes more of the Aromata's fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties: We have in ſtead of Wormwood, ſubſtituted its Syrupe, for the better coalition of the maſs, leſt it grow too dry, or contract chinks and marcour.</p>
                              <p>Thus we have caſtigated <hi>Meſue</hi>'s ſweet Pills, or rather exhibited our own, which are eaſier to make, better, and of leſſer charges: to which, if the maker ſhall put a little of the liquor of Balm, they ſhall exceed all Pills in roborating the ſtomack.</p>
                              <p>Sweet Pills are moſt cuſtomachical,
<note place="margin">Vires.</note> and roborate the nervous parts beſt: for they at once purge craſs, putrid, pituitous, and bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious humours from the ventricle and vicine parts, and recreate the ſame; preſerve native heat, help coction, diſcuſs flatulency, diſpel crudities, reſarciate appetite, help cholical dolours, and conduce to old and frigid men at all times, to bilious and young men onely in winter.</p>

                              <p>The later age retains the old deſcription of <hi>Tralian's</hi> Pills, but not the name: for one calls them Pills of Coloquintida, another of Nitre; and this puts more of Nitre in them, the other more of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquintida. But ſeeing reaſon and uſe have better approved of the weight of ſimples deſcribed by the more Recent, we ſhall follow the Ancients in the materials, but the Recents in the proportion and weight of theſe materials.</p>
                              <p>Now for their confection, prepared Coloquintida, that is, Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chisks of Alhandal, muſt be taken. Bdellium muſt be diſſolved, percolated, and cocted in the calified ſucce of Braſſica, till the ſucce be conſumed; then muſt the reſt be mixed, and a ſufficient quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of the Honey of Roſes mixed with them: Euphorbium muſt not, by the advice of many, be added to the mixture, till thus pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared.</p>
                              <p>Some quantity of Euphorbium muſt be taken, pulverated ſmall, with a little Oyl of Almonds rubbed on a ſtone; like many Colly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; then collected and included in a Quince excavated, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved with paſte; then cocted in a furnace like Scammony: and thus cocted and repared, prepoſed for uſe.</p>
                              <p>Pills of Nitre move frigid, craſs, and viſcid humours,
<note place="margin">Vires.</note> from parts more remote: whence they conduce in nervous affections, and help the had loaden with contumacious diſeaſes; as alſo the Epilepſie, Palſey, Vertigo, and affections of the articles, becauſe they educe both flave and black Bile: ſome believe they are good againſt the Indian diſeaſe, and thence too licentiouſly call them Indian Pills.</p>

                              <p>Practical Medicks ſeek out of Diſpenſatories, as out of a foecund and fertile Garden, all kindes of Medicaments, for the deletion of all diſeaſes; but they finde a great part of them deſcribed without Art or Reaſon, and onely convenient for few diſeaſes: yea, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ten Medicaments indued with the ſame faculties, and diſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated onely by divers names. But we have, according to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities of diſeaſes and humours, tradited divers Medicaments, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed not onely out of vulgar Diſpenſatories, but out of the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of many grave men: beſides which, we do alſo exhibit ſome, proved ſalutiferous by Reaſon, Experience, and ſucceſsful Event; as theſe Pills preſcribed for the Dropſie, which having Mechoacan for their Baſis, from thence mutuate their denomination, which is of Simples moſt praepollent, for educing water by ſtool.

                              <p>The COMMENTARY.</p>
                              <p>They are called foetid Pills, not becauſe they educe foetid hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, as ſome think, but becauſe they conſiſt of foetid Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; as Beavers-ſtones, wilde Rue, Sagapene, Opoponax, and the like. <hi>Rhaſis,</hi> and other Arabians, give other deſcriptions of them; but we retain this onely as the beſt, which <hi>Meſue</hi> calls the greater, in reference to a leſſer deſcription, which we omitted; as leſs efficacious.</p>
                              <pb n="591" facs="tcp:37350:354"/>
                              <p>None, I believe, doubt, whether the ſeed of wilde Rue, or of Hemlock, ſhould rather ingrede the compoſition of foetid Pills: for doubtleſs, Hemlock-ſeed is poyſon; though one <hi>Conſtantinus</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prets the Arabian words <hi>Harmeli, or Harmela,</hi> Hemlock-ſeed, when all others ſay they are wilde Rue-ſeed; in whoſe ſtead, vulgar Rues<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeed may be well ſubſtituted.</p>
                              <p>The Hermodactyls ſhould be exotical, whoſe roots are tubeous and craſs, not rugoſe; which by ſmall contuſion might be reduced to farinaceous powder.</p>
                              <p>They act perperouſly, who take Ephemerian, or Colchian, or our Hermodactyls, whoſe roots are flaccid; for their qualities are not commendable, but noxious, killing by ſmall and ſhort ſuffoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: whence they are called Strangulatories. The beſt Hermoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctyl comes from <hi>Syria,</hi> and is thence called the Syrian Hermodactyl. Eſula ſhould be prepared as we have taught before; the Gummes muſt be melted, percolated, and cocted in the ſucce of Leeks; and the Powders muſt be adjected, mixed, and ſubacted with theſe, which muſt be handled with hands madefied with Oyl of Almonds, involved in Leather, and repoſed in a Tin-box for uſe.</p>
                              <p>Foetid Pills are of much uſe, for they evacuate frigid, pituitous,
<note place="margin">Vires.</note> crude, and alſo bilious humours; and thence cure ſuch affections as ariſe from thence; as the diſeaſes of the Junctures, Podagry, Gonagry, Dolours in the Back-bone, Leproſie, Morphews, Itch, cutaneous infections, and cholical affections.</p>

                              <p>The COMMENTARY.</p>
                              <p>That our Antidotary might not be defective, we have not onely elicited Medicaments out of the Monuments of the Ancients, but out of the Writings and Notes of Neotericks, ſelected and culled what reaſon and ſucceſsful event have celebrated; as theſe Pills of Quickſilver, which the Neotericks uſurp, to the expugnation of a new diſeaſe: For it is juſt, that new diſeaſes ſhould have new reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies invented by Reaſon, and prepared by Art; eſpecially if the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions of the Ancients fail and prove uſeleſs.</p>
                              <pb n="592" facs="tcp:37350:355"/>
                              <p>Now none, I think, will deny, that the French diſeaſe is new, ſeeing it was never heard of in <hi>Europe,</hi> before the year 1493. but then brought by <hi>Chriſtophorus Columbus,</hi> and his aſſociates, from <hi>India</hi> to <hi>Italy,</hi> and there communicated to the Italian women; who bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing victuals to the French Souldiers in the Neapolitan ſiege, with their bodies communicated their diſeaſe to the men; which the men retaining after conqueſt, gave alſo to other Italian women: from whom their returning husbands, perſolving the debt of Matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, catch'd it of their own wives, who had got it of the Frenchmen, the French of Italian women, and they of <hi>Columbus</hi> his Souldiers.</p>
                              <p>Hence the Italians were wroth with the French, and in revenge call their diſeaſe, The French Pox; and ridiculouſly make their Books-fronts proclaim Ultion, by denoting the husbands Ignorance, and the wives Whoredom: their Ignorance, in that they knew not the venereous Pox; the womens Whoredom, in that they had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with the French.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>Braſſavolus,</hi> as it ſhould ſeem, mindeful of this injury done to his Parents, wrote a certain book of this diſeaſe, which he calls <hi>The French-Pox;</hi> wherein he aſſigns 234 differences thereof: certainly either the honeſt man there played the Babler, or elſe ſo many of his acquaintance and kinſwomen were compreſſed by the French ſouldiers, who left theſe Hieroglyphical characters, as eternal ſigns of their new and quaint marriages. But to my purpoſe. There are various preparations of the pills of Quickſilver; for each Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectioner and Chirurgeon almoſt, have their peculiar deſcriptions, which they keep for hidden Secrets; ſome whereof will onely by reiteration, move ſalivation; others frequently uſurped, will a little ſubduce the Belly: but all of them often iterated, move ſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, hurt the nerves, and ſometimes cauſe ſtrangulation. Their uſe therefore is not ſafe, unleſs the Quickſilver be well prepared and caſtigated, by the admiſtion of other Medicaments, as Turpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine-Oyl, or ſuch things as we have in this preſcript deſcribed: The manner of whoſe preparation is apparent enough by the form; but there are other compounds that admit of Quickſilver: of which hereafter.</p>
                              <p>Theſe Pills are Catholical,
<note place="margin">Vires.</note> and Alexiterial, ſeeing they expurge all humours at once, and evince the malign quality of the French-Pox, and radically evel its Veſtigia impreſſed on the parts af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected.</p>

                              <p>AS in Civil Law, many old Laws are obſolete, and of no uſe and vigour to a Magiſtrate: ſo in Medicine, many ancient Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments are either neglected, or quite diſapproved of, as noxious, or at leaſt uſeleſs. Some are omitted, becauſe there are others of
<pb n="593" facs="tcp:37350:355"/>the ſame, or like efficacy and vertue, whereof the beſt is ſelected; for it were a ſign of folly in a man, if he ſhould prepare and keep all the Medicaments <hi>Myrepſus</hi> hath deſigned, who abſolving his Work in 1100 Chapters, hath conjoyned two or three deſcriptions in one Chapter.</p>
                              <p>Yea, neither Medicks deſire, nor Diſeaſes require, that any Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecary ſhould make and keep all the Medicaments that <hi>Aetius, Actuarius,</hi> or <hi>Praepoſitus,</hi> and others, deſcribe, but onely the more ſecure, ſelected, and approved.</p>

                              <p>We have neglected the Indian Pills, and them of the ſtone Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum, becauſe them of the Azure-ſtone are affine to them, and more efficacious.</p>
                              <p>We weigh not the Pills of Rhabarb, becauſe ignave, but give them of Egrimony, as more efficacious; with whom they have affinity.</p>
                              <p>Pills of Hermodactyls exclude the arthretical Pills; and the foetid Pills exclude thoſe that are denominated from Sagapene, Euphor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bium, and Sarcocolla.</p>
                              <p>Pills of Mechoacan make them void, which conſiſts of Eſula and Mezereon.</p>

                              <p>Pills of Bdellium are quite neglected, becauſe they are ſcarce purgative: in ſtead, other better, and more roborative Medicaments, eaſier to be made, may be confected for preſent uſe.</p>
                              <p>I pretermit many more, as unworthy to be named or uſed; for many men deſcribe many Medicaments, not ſo much that they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult others ſanity, as the augmenting of their Diſpenſatories grand bulk.</p>
                              <p>Cathartical Powders being ingrateful, are uſually coagmented into liquid or ſolid Electuaries, or elſe Pills: yet Empiricks give the powder of Stibium onely in a little Wine, or other liquor; as alſo the powder of Mercury, wherewith a veneficous Circulator at <hi>Lutetia</hi> promiſed the cure of all diſeaſes, openly profeſſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a Prophet: but the wretch went about many Cities, to
<pb n="592" facs="tcp:37350:356"/>ſee whom he might devour: he is not worthy to be named. At laſt he ran away.</p>
                              <p>All prepare not Quickſilver or Mercury alike: for ſome include it with <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> in a Matracy, and exhale the water by ſublima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, calling that which remains in the bottom, Powder of Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: It is of a yellowiſh red colour, and rather cauſtical then ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thartical.</p>
                              <p>Others prepare it otherwiſe, but better, thus: They immerge Quickſilver in <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> whereinto they inject Brine; then they let the Quickſilver reſide, and the water is ejected by inclination; and the craſſament that remains, which is whitiſh, is called Powder of Mercury. But in what proportion it ſhould be mixed, how it may be perfectly dealbated, and with what vertue it is indued, I need not recenſeate, leſt Empiricks and Pſeudopharmacopoeans abuſe it: but if it be made as <hi>P. Pijardus,</hi> a learned Pariſian Medick taught, its vertues are eximious and efficacious in curing ſome Diſeaſes, which will not yield to vulgar Medicaments.</p>

                              <p>The Neotericks have retained the old deſcription, but not the name of theſe Pills: for <hi>Meſue</hi> their Author calls them from their effect, Pills for all diſeaſes; but theſe call them Pills of Cyno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gloſs, which is neither for quantity nor quality prepollent therein: perhaps they miſtake Cynogloſs for Arnogloſs, which might more properly give them denomination; for ſeeing <hi>Meſue</hi> deſcribed them for aſtriction, Arnogloſs being of an aſtrictive quality, was more convenient; but we, with <hi>Fernelius,</hi> admit of the new name, and adde Caſtorium for the caſtigation of Opium: But we think, that Rho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doſtagm or Roſe-water, is altogether inconvenient for the receipt of the powders, if we would have the maſs of a legitimate conſiſtence, or fit to be kept; and we ſubſtitute in its ſtead Syrupe of Stcechados, by whoſe quality the head will be roborated, and armed againſt the nocuments of Opium, and by its lentour the powders will be coacted into a more idoneous maſs: as for its confection, the root of Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nogloſs muſt firſt be brayed with the ſeed of Henbane, and then the other ſimples apart; the brayed Opium muſt be firſt ſubacted by the Syrupe, then the other powders muſt be mixed, and coacted into a maſs.</p>

                              </head>
                              <p>NOt many years ago, there aroſe a company of Pſeudo-Medicks, who in ſtead of the uſual Pills of Cynogloſs, exhibited a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain confection, which they called <hi>Laudanum;</hi> whereby they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed not onely to conciliate ſleep, but abigate all diſeaſes. I then ſaw a Circulator, who boaſted by his Laudanum, to revoke men al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt exanimated or half dead, and man the Encomium of this Medicine ſo won upon men, that no Empirick ſo ſtupid, no Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſter ſo dull, nor Tonſor ſo plebeious, but he was a Laudaniſter, or elſe not worth flaming.</p>
                              <p>I wooed ſome with prayers, ſome with price, to tell me this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicament; but found amongſt twenty of its deſcriptions, not one like another: yea, he that was moſt ignorant, would profeſs he had the beſt.</p>
                              <p>But I heard ſome Mountebanks exhibit Pills of Cynogloſs for Laudanum, extorting for each Pill the weight of half a ſcruple in gold. And thus were the credulous Plebeians, drawn with new names, and unuſual words, circumvented by the ſubtilty of theſe rafrous Juglers.</p>
                              <pb n="596" facs="tcp:37350:357"/>
                              <p>The deſcriptions of Laudanum given by more perite Alchymiſts, are ſeldome and hardly made; for they conſiſt of the beſt of Gems, Hyacinths, and Corals; of the eſſence of Saffron and Opium; of the Oyls of Cinamon, Cloves; Liquor of Margarites, Powder of Unicorns-horn, of the Bezar-ſtone, Amber-griſe, and other precious ſtones: and doubtleſs a confection of theſe materials muſt needs be eximious: and I approve of the learned rich Alchymiſts acts, who make, keep, and exhibit this to the diſeaſed: but alas! the improbous do ſo impoſe upon us, that we can ſcarce give the honeſt and good. I ſaw a certain Laudanum exhibited by a learned Princely Medick, which wrought happy effects.</p>
                              <p>This ſequel one is eximious, and eaſie to be made.</p>

                              <p>There might be innumerable deſcriptions thereof given: for every one, though meanly learned, ſtrives to adde or detract at pleaſure; either for the fame, or imitation of other opiate Medicaments, as of Philonium, by which name <hi>Crato</hi> deſigned Laudanum, which he held to be nothing but a certain Philonium, which many Alchy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts take for the baſis of their Laudanum; and by adding magiſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, eſſences, and tinctures, make an hypnotical Medicament, more commendable then the vulgar Philonium. But I admire moſt, that every one changes the form of his Medicament, and that none can know which is the genuine, true, and beſt deſcription thereof: which ſome take from <hi>Paracelſus,</hi> others from <hi>Keckius;</hi> ſome from <hi>Andernacus,</hi> others from <hi>Brunerius;</hi> and others from others: and alwayes change ſomething, that they may be thought the firſt Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors.

                                 <p>This maſs is not kept whole, after the manner of other pills, but
<pb n="597" facs="tcp:37350:357"/>divided into particles, of a whole or half ſcruples weight; which are after formed at pleaſure, one while into triangular or multifa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Trochisks; another while into round lumps or Pills: whence ſome refer them to Paſtils, others to Pills. But ſeeing they ſhould be holden under the tongue, a ſphaerical form is moſt convenient for them, for ſo they may be abvolved all over, and liquefie in all the parts of the mouth. For which uſe, other Trochisks may be made, as we have ſhewed in the twentieth Chapter, firſt Section and fifth Book of our Inſtitutions. The manner of their confection is eaſie. Decorticated Almonds muſt firſt be minutely incided with a Knife, then levigated on a Marble: then Amylum and Sugar muſt be taken: afterwards the ſucce of Liquorice muſt be bray'd in a pretty hot metalline morter; then Tragacanthum: let all then be made with the Mucago, into ſome paſte, whereof plain Pills may be made, dryed and kept.</p>

                                 <p>Seeing the Author of theſe Pills is uncertain, every one doth at will change their deſcription, by adding or detracting ſomething. But we have exhibited the moſt uſual form whereby Pills that are Bechical, grateful and white may be made: the manner whereof is well known to all.</p>
                                 <p>They are much commended for leniating the aſperity of the jaws,

The Roman Philoniom, and the confection of Hyacinth, have the ſame preparation and conſiſtence, and are both deſcribed amongst Roboratives; yet the former is called an Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative.

                           <p>Aromatical or Cordial Powders, are either kept alone in a fit veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel well operculated, that their faculties may not expire; or with Honey ſolved into a liquid Electuary; or with Sugar cocted into a ſolid Electuary or Tabels. They are kept alone in ſhops, that a part of them, when uſe requires, may be diſſolved into applicative Medicaments, or mixed with introſumptive ones.</p>
                           <p>This powder, which is denominated from Pearl, is ſo variouſly deſcribed, that its Author is not known, but every one changes it variouſly at will: This though, which we have exhibited out of <hi>Platerius,</hi> is by moſt learned Writings atteſted the moſt genuine.</p>
                           <p>And it is called frigid Diamargaritum, to difference it from an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, which is hotter, but made of few of none: it is alſo called the compounded Diamargaritum, in reference to <hi>Manus Chriſti,</hi> which conſiſts onely of the Sugar of Roſes, and of Pearls. There is yet another compounded one, which admits of many precious Stones, Amber, and Musk; but differing from the Electuary of Gemmes, onely in that it refrigerates more. It is ſeldom made.</p>
                           <p>The preparation of Diamargaritum is moſt in triture, whereof we have largely treated in our Inſtitutions. Pearls are oriental and pellucid, which are proved by their candor, rotundity, ſmoothneſs, weight, and magnitude. Thoſe that are ponderous and craſs, are called vinous: which becauſe of their rarity and value, ſeldom in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grede Medicinal Compoſitions; they ſhould, like Coral, be ducted, and levigated upon a Purple-ſtone: The four cold ſeeds muſt be minutely incided, and pulverated very ſmall; then the reſt, and all confuſedly mixed at laſt.</p>

                           <p>This compoſition is kept either in form of a powder, or of an Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary; and that either ſoft, conſiſting of an equal quantity of powders, and of honey of Roſes; or ſolid, conſiſting of the ſame, and Sugar of Roſes: but it is moſt commodious, to keep its powder well occluded in fit veſſels for future uſes.</p>
                           <p>It takes its name from the Gems or precious ſtones, of which it is made, with the vulgar, and others rare and unknown cordials, whoſe faculties cannot be well learned from the Ancients or Neotericks, as appears by the examination we had of Been: in whoſe ſtead, we ſubſtitute Enula-Campana's roots, both roots being paſtinacious, cordial, and hotter then Bugloſs or Borrage, which ſome take for both the Beens: the root alſo of Tormentil may be ſubſtituted in ſtead of each Been. But I do not fancy their humours, who in compoſition of this ſolemn Electuary, uſurp thoſe exoticall roots deſigned by the name of the two Beens; for either Tormentil alone, or Enula alone, or an equal quantity of each, may be much better aſſumed for both Beens: and if any one would rather have Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lica's root, then that of Enula, he may.</p>
                           <p>The preparation of this powder, conſiſts in idoneus triture; the Gemmes and Corals muſt be levigated on a purple ſtone; the roots, woods, and fruits brayed in a morter, and all at length com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixed.</p>
                           <p>The Electuary of Gems is moſt efficacious for the cold affections of the brain, heart, ventricle, liver, and uterus, according to <hi>Meſue:</hi> for it helps the melancholical, ſad, ſolitary, and fearful; it cures the palpitation of the heart, hinders ſwounding, roborates the languid ventricle, and recreates all the intrails: but Apothecaries ſeldome make it, becauſe of the rarity and dearneſs of the ſimples that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grede its compoſition.</p>

                           <p>The COMMENTARY.</p>
                           <p>This compound is very aromatical and ſweet, both becauſe of the Amber, from which it is denominated, and of the Musk, and other Aromata's that ingrede it. It is kept either in form of a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, or of a ſolid Electuary, or of Honey: if it be required of a hard conſiſtence, as that of Tabels, its powder muſt be received in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Sugar of Roſes perfectly cocted; if ſoft, like that of Opiates, its powders muſt be received into the Julep of Roſes, or Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drian Syrupe.</p>
                           <p>Its preparation is onely pulveration; which muſt be effected as we have demonſtrated in the 9 and 10 Chap. and 2 Book of our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions.</p>
                           <p>Diambra doth moſt efficaciouſly roborate the bowels,
<note place="margin">Vires.</note> eſpecially if their imbecillity be from a cold cauſe: for by calefaction it refects the ſpirits, and foments the native heat; it helps the affections of the Uterus, and is very convenient for old men and women.</p>

                           <p>Vulgar Pharmacopolitan Diſpenſatories abound with many cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial, but intenſely calefactive Powders, and very few refrigeratives, conſiſting onely of all kindes of hot Aromata's, promiſcuouſly and confuſedly agregated without choyce or care: Of which ſort, the two laſt deſcriptions (as tradited by the Ancients) were, and many more, which occur in each Antidotary, are: for, Diacyminum, Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſum, Diazinziber, Diatrium Pipereon, Diamargaritum calidum,
<pb n="602" facs="tcp:37350:360"/>Diamoſchum; both ſweet and amare, produce all the ſame effects, having all the ſame faculties, as compounded all of hot Aromata's. Wherefore I have not onely caſtigated, but neglected the antique deſcription of Diamoſchum, and ſubſtituted another, which well refers the reaſon of its name and compoſition, conducing to imbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility wrought by a hot cauſe: for it ſeemed to me ſuperfluous, to retain the ancient deſcription of Diamoſchum, when Diambra, and the Electuary of Gems pollicitate the ſame effects: Therefore I have exhibited another moſt fragrant Diamoſchum, very efficacious in curing hot diſtempers, and eaſily preparable.</p>
                           <p>Sweet Diamoſchum,
<note place="margin">Vires.</note> conſiſting of many Cordials, exhilarates the noble parts, eſpecially the heart and vital faculties, made lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guid or imbecile from any, but mainly a hot cauſe: It conduces alſo to many affections of the Uterus.</p>

                           <p>The COMMENTARY.</p>
                           <p>Amongſt twenty deſcriptions of this compoſition, I have not found two alike: for ſome in ſtead of Zuccaria, put Hemlock-ſeed, as <hi>Joubertus;</hi> others the ſeeds of Pſyllium, as <hi>Foefius;</hi> others omit both, as <hi>Cordus;</hi> others will have Sugar-candy; and others Violets, as <hi>Euchſius.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>There is the ſame diffidence about Rhabarb, Amylum, and Camphyr; which ſome reject, others adde. I have with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent alſo of learned Authors, deſcribed this form, and added Pſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lium as very convenient: but I have expunged Amylum as unapt; for its viſcidity obſtructs: Camphyr I admit, that by its tenuity it may introduce the craſſer Medicaments: but I have detracted from its quantity, leſt by its graveolence, it ſhould obtund or deleate the ſuavity of the Aromata's, which are but few.</p>
                           <p>I alſo allow of Tragacanthum and Arabick, which ſhould be alit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle aſſated before commixtion, that they may depoſe their viſcidity, and become more convenient for the Authors intention, who, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he was, aimed this Medicament partly to roborate, and partly to reſolve obſtructions.</p>
                           <p>Its preparation is like the former's, depending on due triture.</p>
                           <p>It mirificouſly conduces to the freeing the liver from obſtructions:
<note place="margin">Vires.</note> it helps ſuch as have the jaundies, or are tabid, or troubled with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate

                           <p>There are two deſcriptions of this name; one given by <hi>Rhaſis,</hi> which is ſeldome made; the other by an uncertain Author, which we have tranſcribed out of <hi>Praepoſitus</hi> as better. They erre, that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute this confection to <hi>Galen;</hi> for it is not contained in his Works, neither did he know many of its ingredients, as Musk, Camphyr, Amber, and Pearls.</p>
                           <p>It is alled the laetificant, or Powder of gladneſs, from its effect; for it laetificates the heart and ſpirits: we have expunged Balm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood out of its confection, being very precious and rare, and in its ſtead ſubſtituted Citrian Santal: Lentisks, and Aloes-wood are alſo good ſubſtitutes for Balm-wood; as alſo for the Hatts heart-bone,
<pb n="605" facs="tcp:37350:361"/>its Horn: The reſt being alwayes in readineſs, need no ſubſtitutes. The preparation is the ſame with the precedents.</p>
                           <p>The laetificant Electuary denotes its eximious faculties by its name; it laetificates the heart, and all the vital parts and faculties,
<note place="margin">Vires.</note> recreates the bowels, abſumes excrementitious humours, diſſipates flatulency, and roborates the ventricle.</p>

                           <p>We have rejected the old deſcription of this Powder, which vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar Apothecaries call Lithontribon, becauſe it receives many aſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctives, and ſome things that hinder its efficacy in breaking the ſtone, and extracting the ſand of the Reins; and others that are too rare and precious, or can never be had ſincere: in whoſe ſtead we give another Lithontripticon, moſt aptly compoſed, to break the ſtone, expel ſand, and cure other affections of the Reins and Bladder.</p>
                           <p>But before Goats-blood ingrede its compoſition, it ſhould be thus prepared: Firſt, a Goat of four years old, or thereabouts, ſhould be ſelected and jugulated; the blood which comes out in the middle, muſt be put in an earthen pot, for that which flows out firſt is too tenuious, the laſt too craſs; then the pot muſt be covered with a rare linen cloth, and expoſed to the Sun, that the blood may coagulate; the watry muſt be rejected, and the more craſs concreted blood dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, brayed, and kept in a glaſs veſſel: they are too ſuperſtitious, who will not kill the Goat, till the Sun be entring into <hi>Cancer,</hi> and he have been nouriſhed a long time with Saxifrage, Pimpinella, Smallage, and the like; nor collect any, ſave the arterial blood: for though this preparation be not uſeleſs, yet it is not neceſſary; nay, there can ſcarce be ſuch plenty of thoſe plants they require got, as will nouriſh a Goat a long time: and beſides, his blood, whoſe pabulum is not changed, is as efficacious for breaking the ſtone.</p>
                           <p>The Hares-blood newly extracted, muſt be ſo aſſated, that it turn not to aſhes, but may be pulverated. There is nothing beſides in this preparation, either difficult or operous.</p>

                           <p>Medicaments which oppugn the Plague, expugn Poyſons, evert their harm, and defend life, are by the Greeks called <hi>Antidota,</hi> by the Arabians <hi>Bezaardica;</hi> of which ſort there are ſome ſimples, as the Bezar-ſtone, Zerumbet, and Precious-ſtones; ſome compounds, as Cordials, and Theriacals, which conſiſt of many things that ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borate the heart, ſpirits, and vital parts, extinguiſhing poyſons and venenate qualities: therefore they are ſaid to be in a mean, partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pating both of our nature and poyſonous qualities; as Mithridate, whoſe frequent uſe is not ſafe, where there is no ſuſpicion of a vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate quality; for if it finde no object on which it may act, it leaves the veſtigia of its inimick quality impreſſed on the parts, accending the humours, and preying upon the native calour.</p>
                           <p>But ſuch compound Medicaments as conſiſt onely of cordial and roborative ingredients, and by ſome ſpecial faculty oppugning poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, are at all ſeaſons convenient for all temperatures and diſeaſes;
<pb n="609" facs="tcp:37350:363"/>as this Powder we have deſcribed, whoſe faculties are eximious in expugning malign affections, and defending the noble parts.</p>
                           <p>And it is given in water, or ſome cordial decoction, or idoneous conſerve; or elſe it is excepted in the Syrupe of Kermes, or Lem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, or concinnated into the form of an Opiate: it may alſo with Honey deſpumed in ſome cordial water, be coagmentated into the form of a liquid Electuary, and kept in ſhops like other confections.

                           <p>It is miraculouſly efficacious in expugning venenate, contagious,

                           <p>℞ <hi>of the leaves of Rue, Vervine, Sage, Plantain, Polypody, common Wormwood, Mint, Mugwort, Balm, Betony, S. Johns-wort, the leſſer Centaury, of each m.j. let them be dryed, and at laſt reducated into a fine Powder.</hi>

                           <p>The COMMENTARY.</p>
                           <p>This alexiterial Powder I deſumed from the famous <hi>Jul. Palma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> who wrote ſeven Books of contagious Diſeaſes: the eximious faculties, and admirable effects of this Medicament, not onely he, but <hi>Dominus de Pyrou,</hi> hath frequently and ſucceſsfully experienced upon many; from whom he confeſſes he had its firſt deſcription: for as many as were bitten with mad Dogs, and uſed this, were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently freed from imminent and incipient Hydrophoby, if no part of the head above the teeth, or cold member, were abluted; for then there were ſmall hopes of remedy.</p>
                           <p>We call this Powder <hi>ANtilyſſum,</hi> becauſe in arceating madneſs, it is inferiour to none: it cures wounds inflicted by mad Dogs, and impedes that terrible ſymptome, whereby thoſe wretches are fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of water.</p>
                           <p>The preparation of this famous Antidote is eaſie; wherein theſe three things are chiefly obſervable: Firſt, that the Simples be then collected, when they are moſt vertuous, to wit, in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning or end of the Spring; That they be not dryed either by the ſcorching Sun, or in a moiſt place; That when they are dry, they be kept, with this reſerve, that they be renovated annually.</p>
                           <p>There is no need, that any great quantity of this eximious Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der be kept in Pharmacopolies: for it is enough, if half a pound thereof be reconded in a fit veſſel for preſent uſe: But its materials
<pb n="610" facs="tcp:37350:364"/>or ſimples ſhould be kept in abundance, artificially dryed, incloſed in chartaceous bags, and ſecurely repoſed, that Flyes may not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſparcate them, nor Mice erode them; and when exigence calls for them, an equal weight of each ſhould be pulverated, and a whole or half dragm thereof given in the morning before meat, in a ſpoon, with twice as much Sugar; or elſe in pottage, or other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient liquor, as Wine, Sider; or elſe in Honey, like an Opiate.</p>
                           <p>And although one or two dragms be a doſis ſufficient for a very robuſt man; yet three or four may ſometimes be exhibited, by ſuch eſpecially, who have been bitten long before, or are already begun to fear water.</p>
                           <p>This Powder is indeed very eximious; but it would be more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacious, if the Powder of Pimpinel and burnt River-Crabfiſhes were mixed with it: Its name Alyſſum ſhews, that it is juſtly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before all other of that ſort; for <hi>Galen</hi> and <hi>Dioſcorides</hi> call it ſo, becauſe it cures madneſs, and extinguiſhes its poyſon.</p>
                           <p>But this plant is rare, and known onely to few: it is in aſpect like Horehound, but each genicle emits onely two criſped, hoary, and almoſt inodorate leaves; ſpinous cups do verticularly circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt its Caulicles: I have often ſeen it in the Colledge-Garden in <hi>Paris.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>There is another kinde in <hi>Germany,</hi> called <hi>Echioides,</hi> like Tizil in form; but it is inferiour to that of <hi>Galens:</hi> yet he that wants the one, may ſubſtitute the other.</p>

                           <head>CHAP. 16. <hi>Crocus Martis; or,</hi> Mars <hi>his Saffron.</hi>
                           </head>
                           <p>THis Medicament is ſo denominated, partly from its matter, as it is the filings of Steel, or Iron, dedicated to <hi>Mars;</hi> and partly from its colour, which reſembles Saffron: Its preparation is multifarious; for every one prepares it after his own Model, in which every one diſſents from another: whence ſome have neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or diſapproved of its preparation, as uſeleſs; and <hi>Rivierius</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibits the bare limature of Iron, for true Saffron of <hi>Mars,</hi> without uſtion or ablution; profeſſing it to be ſafer, and more efficacious in curing the foetid colours of Virgins: but he that will follow the method of ſo raſh a Periclitator, ſhall be more formidable then the very diſeaſes.</p>
                           <p>I finde two preparations of this Saffron, more uſual then the reſt: the firſt is vulgar, and well known to Pharmacopoliſts, who burn the filings of Steel twice, or more, in a crucible, and waſh it as oft, partly in Vinegar, partly in Roſe-water, or other fit liquor; then dry it, and make a ſubruſe ponderous Powder, which they call pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared Steel.</p>
                           <p>The ſecond is uſed by the Chymiſts, who make this ponderous Powder volarile; whoſe preparation they thus effect: ſometimes
<pb n="611" facs="tcp:37350:364"/>they aſſume the limature of Steel, ſometimes of Iron, or of both, for the qualities are ſimilar; they burn it a day or two in their fire, then they inject it into water, and aſſume and keep what ſwims above; and, abjecting the water, take what is in the bottom, and inject it again into the reverberatory fire, where they burn it as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and again dimit it into water: what ſwims above, they again take and keep; what ſinks to the bottom, they again burn, till it ſubſide not, but remain upon the ſuperficies of the water; which they collect, dry, and keep for ſpecial Chymical Martical Saffron.</p>
                           <p>Some make it thus: They put the limature of Iron on a diſh in a very hot fire, and permit it to be red hot: when it is cold, they bray it laboriouſly in an Iron-Morter; then waſh it, that the more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime part may be ſeparated with the water: the craſſer is again burned, and brayed as before; which they iterate ſeven or more times, till all the limature become croceous.</p>
                           <p>Some waſh the limature of Iron in Brine, before they calcinate it; and afterwards in Vinegar: ſome macerate it in Urine, others put Salt to it, and others Tartar: ſome burn it with Sulphur, others turn it into Rubigo: but as theſe preparations are too curious, ſo are they needleſs; and it is better to hold to one good way, then hover doubtful amongſt ſo many.</p>
                           <p>But the duſt of Iron muſt be filed very ſmall for this purpoſe, that it may be better calcinated by the fire; then it muſt be brayed, afterwards demerged, and much agitated in water, and the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natant part collected, dryed with moderate heat, and kept without further calcination: the craſſer part muſt be again immitted into the fire, till the whole become volatile, and then it is true Martial Saffron.</p>
                           <p>Alchymiſts make it alſo of other Metals; for they have Saffron of Tinne, Saffron of <hi>Venus:</hi> but by how much they ſeem more perite Artificers, by ſo much they are more imperite Medicks.</p>
                           <p>They ſay, that <hi>Mars</hi> his Saffron roborates the liver and ſpleen,
<note place="margin">Vires.</note> takes away the obſtructions of the bowels, and therefore cures the foetid colour of Virgins.</p>
                           <p>Of this and other Cordial Powders, prudent Medicks make a Confection in form of a ſoft Electuary or Tabels, called <hi>Diaſtomoma,</hi> moſt efficacious in removing obſtructions, wherewith they mix the Powder of Worms: But I had rather make it thus:</p>

                              <p>The Author of this Powder is moſt uncertain, but its uſe moſt frequent: it ſhould be conveniently excepted in Sugar, duly cocted in the white of an Egge, clarified with Coltsfoot-water, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinnated into Tabels or Lozenges: Each ounce of Powder muſt have a pound of Sugar; yea, they ſometimes put two ounces of Sugar to one dragm of Powder: and the Electuary thus made, is more grateful, but leſs efficacious; as on the contrary, when each dragm of Powder receives an ounce of Sugar.</p>
                              <p>The manner of its preparation is ſo eaſie, that it needs no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deſcription.</p>

                              <p>It is kept either in form of a Powder, or of a ſolid Electuary; which, by the Authors advice, may be thus made: Three ounces of Violers muſt be macerated and cocted in a pound of water, till the water be of a violaceous colour; one pound of Sugar muſt be coct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the colature, to the conſiſtence of a ſolid Electuary; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, whilſt hot, the Penidees, and other levigated ſimples, muſt be

                                 <p>The COMMENTARY.</p>
                                 <p>The greater part of Pharmacopoliſts infuſe ſilk dyed in the ſucce of tinctured grains, or Kermes newly tincted in Roſe-water: But <hi>Joubertus,</hi> to whom I aſſent, would rather infuſe crude ſilk in the ſaid liquor, and then adde the ſucce of Kermes to the expreſſion; for ſo
<pb n="616" facs="tcp:37350:367"/>there is leſs loſs; and the vertue of the ſilk, if it have any, may be eaſily elicited before tincture, by infuſion: And though its firſt Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor <hi>Meſue</hi> inſtituted it otherwiſe, yet it is no piacle to diſcede ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from him, or any other Author, if the thing may be made either better, or more uſeful thereby. I rather aſſent therefore to ſuch as infuſe crude ſilk in Roſe-water, and ſucce of Apples, and afterwards adde Kermes to the expreſſion.</p>
                                 <p>It is prudently provided in the Roman Antidotary, that onely four ounces of ſilk be macerated, ſeeing it may not be totally omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with loſs to the Medicament: for, as I would not be refractory, ſo would not I be too credulous, nor ſuffer every thing that is ſpoken or written, too precipitantly to inhere in my minde. And that I may ſpeak freely, <hi>Sericum</hi> being the excrement of a certain ſordid Inſect, I can ſcarce perſwade my ſelf, that it is indued with ſo great vertue as the Ancients put upon it. I know indeed that Clay is not deſtitute of faculties, and that the qualities of Animals Hair, Cleys, and very dung, are not contemptible; but, if not cordial, yet effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, by their ſharp and troubleſome quality. But more of ſilk in its proper place. I now return to our confection, wherein the Azure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone is put; yet not ſo prepared, as in the confection of thoſe Pills, which are denominated from it: for therein it is exhibited crude, that its purgative faculty may remain intire; but here burnt, that it may periſh; in both pulverated, and frequently waſhed, that it may depoſe its vomitory, and keep its cordial and roborative fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty.</p>
                                 <p>It muſt be burned in a crucible or ſmall earthen pot, then brayed, and often waſhed, firſt in common water, then in cordial, as Roſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water, or ſuch convenient liquor, and dryed, till the water after lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion remain limpid.</p>
                                 <p>This is a precious, but not ſo operous a compound, as the <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtane</hi> Diſpenſatory portends: it is prepared as other Confections. The ſole diſſent about its compoſition, is in the tincture of the ſilk, and the weight of Musk, which ſome augment, others minuate: if Aloes-wood cannot be had, Citrian Santals may be ſubſtituted.</p>
                                 <p>It is very efficacious for many things;
<note place="margin">Vires.</note> for it cures the palpita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the heart, ſwoundings, doting, and ſadneſs without a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt cauſe; and much helps ſuch as are languid, wearied with long ſickneſs, and newly recovered.</p>

                                 <p>Neotericks invented this Confection, which the <hi>Mompelian</hi> Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicks, who were firſt ſeen to uſurp it, had in much uſe. It agrees onely nominally with that in the firſt Section of the greater Lumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, which is denominated of Hyacinth, under the authority of its Inventor <hi>Galen.</hi> But whoever was the Author of this, he hath ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected the beſt Medicaments, congeſted them in the beſt Method and Order; and therefore I judge nothing changeable herein, unleſs it be Ivory, which I think were better crude then burnt; and Silk, which I would willingly detract, or tinct it in Kermes before com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.</p>
                                 <p>Some require a greater weight of ſimples, who may by my per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion either augment or leſſen the quantity, if they detract not from the vertue and efficacy of the mixture; for a little change is none.</p>
                                 <p>It much helps the heart and noble parts in their affections;
<note place="margin">Vires.</note> it cures the Syncope, exhilarates the heart, emends palpitation, dulco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates the breath, takes away melancholy, and her ſiſter ſadneſs, without a manifeſt cauſe: it cures venenate and contagious diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, and produces the ſame effects with the confection of Scarlet grains.</p>

                                 <p>In this confection, Bay-berries, (which give the name) the leaves of Rue, Origanum, and wilde Mint, make up a Baſis: it admits of many hot and inciding ſeeds, to attenuate viſcid humours, califie frigid humours, and diſſipate flatulency; of Gummes, to deterge and diſcuſs; and of Honey, to receive and conſerve the Powders, and to make the compound more efficacious and pleaſant.</p>
                                 <p>The Gummes being few, and preſcribed in ſmall quantity, need not be ſolved in any liquor, but minutely incided, and pulverated with the reſt; then all received together in deſpumed Honey, whilſt yet hot, and coacted into the form of an Opiate.</p>

                                 <p>The COMMENTARY.</p>
                                 <p>There are many deſcriptions hereof, of which this is the beſt, moſt uſual, and uſeful; but there being many kindes of Satyrion,
<pb n="619" facs="tcp:37350:368"/>that which hath but one teſticle muſt be ſelected, and that in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Spring, when it is moſt ſucculent.</p>
                                 <p>Some rather take Parſnips-root, then that of Eryngium; but I much matter not which, for their faculties are affine: and I do not ſo much eſteem them, as labouring Ruſticks, who almoſt daily feed upon them both, and yet are no more ſalacious then before. Rocket indeed I value more, for that will excite the moſt ſlow to Venery; though Land-Crocodiles or Scinci do moſt potently excite thereto, the fleſh of whoſe Loyns I prefer before their Tayl. There is ſome dubitation about Onyon-ſeed: ſeeing no Medick hath explicitely determined, of what ſort, among ſo many varieties of Onyons, the ſeed muſt be; therefore I ſubſtitute Nettle-ſeed, which is moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruent to that purpoſe, in its ſtead.</p>
                                 <p>And it is thus made: Firſt the roots muſt be boyled in ſufficient water, till they be tabid; then they muſt be baked, and tranſmitted through a hair-ſieve; then mixed with deſpumed and cocted Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and then again fervefied on a ſlow fire, till the aqueous hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midity be abſumed; afterwards the Pine-kernels and Piſtack-nuts muſt be taken, and minutely cut, and then levigated like the reſt; the Musk muſt be brayed apart, and laſt of all confuſedly mixed with the Cinamon. The old deſcription hath an equal weight of Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtack-nuts and Satyrion; whereas the Piſtack being inſuave, and more unapt for the end, ſhould be taken in much leſs quantity.</p>
                                 <p>Diaſatyrion augments the ſeed, ſtimulates venery,
<note place="margin">Vires.</note> erects the Yard, excites the languid and drowſie to venery, roborates the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becility of the reins and bladder, and augments ſtrength.</p>

                                 <p>
                                    <hi>Actuarius</hi> calls this the Aſyncrital, that is, the incomparable An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidote, becauſe it hath no equal in excellency. Now that it may be made to the Authors minde, the Opium muſt be macerated in ſweet Sape, till it be of the conſiſtence of Honey: the Storax muſt be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in honey, wherewith ſome dry Powders may be commixed. We have upon good grounds, and much conſent, ſubſtituted vulgar ligneous Caſſia, or Cane, in ſtead of the Author's Aegyptian Caſſia; and not Caſſia Fiſtula, or the purgative Cane, which <hi>Actuarius</hi> all along calls Black Caſſia, which is no convenient ingredient in an Antidote.</p>
                                 <p>This Antidote cures old head-aches,
<note place="margin">Vires.</note> mitigates vertiginous and comitial affections, takes away too much vigilancy, and reſtrains fury and frenzy: it indulges the dolours of the eyes by defluxion, helps the tooth-ach, difficulty of breathing, old coughs, the inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the ſides, both dry and humid: it exhauſts all the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midity from off the lungs, condenſes thin ſpittle, and makes it more fit for excretion.</p>
                                 <p>It is of preſent help for the ſtomack, aſtringing its humid laxity; it takes away loathſomneſs and ſighing, hinders vomitings, and ſo ſtayes the meat newly ingeſted, ſolves all inflations of the ſtomack and belly into ructures, cures the Jaundies, conduces to melancholy, abrogating its ſad ſymptomes, removes the gravity of the ſpleen, reſtores colour to the face, diſpels obſtructions, moves urine, detur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates ſand, cures the calamities of the Uterus, and cholical dolours, and many other affections, if what <hi>Actuarius</hi> hath publiſhed of this Opiate be true.</p>

                                 <p>The COMMENTARY.</p>
                                 <p>No Medicament is ſo doubtful and various, as <hi>Philonius</hi> the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher's Antidote; to which it happens, as it doth to wine which is poured out of one veſſel into another, which cannot be without loſs: for as many as have written of Pharmacy, have retained its name, but nothing more. <hi>Galen</hi> alone approves of it; but withall he ſaith, he ſubſcribes many under it more famous and better. <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repſus</hi> gave four Antidotes of that name; one whereof admits of Opium; one dimits it: the other are ſcarce like theſe, and very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>congruent to the true Philonium. <hi>Praepoſitus</hi> detracted a few things from the former deſcription, and added many more: ſome have added Caſtorium, others Poppy-ſeed: We approve of <hi>Praepoſitus</hi> his deſcription, in ſtead of Coſtum, ſubſtituting Caſtorium, the true caſtigator of Opium. We have otherwiſe diſpoſed the order of the Simples, and leſſened the quantity of Pepper, Euphorbium, and Bartram; for ſo we have made it more ſecure, without fear of inflammation: For we have ſeen ſome complaining of great ardour in the bottom of the belly, and the ſtraight inteſtine, by the inje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of a Glyſter, wherein half a dragm of Philonium had been diſſolved; which is no wonder, ſeeing it conſiſts of ſeventeen Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, all hot, beſides Opium, which ſome ſay is hot alſo, and Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bane: yea, it can ſcarce be ſwallowed, but it offends the jaws with its ardour and acrimony. But as it is by us emended, it may be ſafely aſſumed at the mouth, without any offence to the ventricle, gale or jaws. It is called Roman Philonium, becauſe it was much uſed at <hi>Rome.</hi>
                                 </p>
                                 <p>It is preſcribed to the Pleuriſie and Cholick; whence ſome call it the Cholical Antidote; and to all internal dolours.
<note place="margin">Vires.</note> It conci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liates ſleep, ſtayes blood iſſuing from the internals, takes away loathſomneſs, allayes the dolours of the belly, ſpleen, liver and reins, ariſing from a cold diſtemper, flatulency, or crude humours, and ſtayes ſighing.</p>
                                 <p>It muſt be aſſumed at the mouth onely in ſmall quantity, as the bigneſs of a Peaſe, or little more, according to the age and ſtrength of the aſſument; and it muſt be variouſly diſſolved, for various pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes;
<pb n="622" facs="tcp:37350:370"/>ſometimes in the decoctions of Plants; ſometimes in wine: <hi>Actuarius</hi> gave it to the ſick in the ſtomack, in the ſucce of the ſprigs of Ciſtus, and a little wine.</p>
                                 <p>But it is moſt frequently injected into the belly by the fundament in a decoction of Glyſters; which are preſcribed for the cure of the moſt grievous cholical dolours: whereunto, this much conduces.</p>

                                 <p>The COMMENTARY.</p>
                                 <p>The deſcription of this Electuary is as uncertain, as the former's Author's name; for neither are known: Yet there is no Seplaſiary ſo rude, but he will boaſt, That he hath its beſt deſcription. I have ſeen many, but never two alike: that is beſt, which is divulged by the <hi>Auguſtane</hi> Medicks; yet ſome things therein are not tolerable: for though its ingredients be few, and deſcribed in ſmall quantity, yet there is half an ounce of Camphyr, and as much Muſtard as may equalize both the Saffron and Egge yolk there preſcribed: whereas neither of them may be ſo admitted; the Muſtard being very hot, and not cordial; the Camphyr cordial, but not ſuaveolent, ſave in ſmall quantity. Beſides, thoſe grave men command the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and the Theriack to be mixed together, without the intervent of Honey, or a Syrupe: and ſo it cannot be an Opiate, but a Paſte, more ſolid then any maſs for Pills. But we have detracted Muſtard from it as noxious, and Pimpinella as uſeleſs; adding thereto Enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la, Mace, and Cinamon, as cordial and bezoardical; we have inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted a juſt doſis of Camphyr, an idoneous quantity of Theriack, and a fit Syrupe for their receipt and ſubaction. It ſhould be a new Hens-egge, of a moderate magnitude, through whoſe perforated head, the White ſhould be educed, and the Yolk left: what is em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pty, ſhould be filled with Oriental, not pulveriſatous Saffron; and the hole ſtopped with Paſte, or another ſhell, that nothing might expire; then the included being cocted in a furnace or oven, by a ſlow fire, muſt be pulverated, the ſhells being abjected.</p>
                                 <p>Some diſallow of the vomitory Nut, becauſe it is deletery to Dogs and Cats, and ſubverts Man's ventricle. But we have oft ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied to this dubitation, for the nature of Man differs from that of Brutes; for that is often poyſon to men, which to beaſts is meat. Thus Starlings feed on Hemlock, which is death to man; Aloes and bitter Almonds kill Foxes, which man ſafely uſes. Furthermore, the vomitory Nut being alexiterial, and provoking vomit, is very convenient; for vomits conduce much in contagious diſeaſes, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to ſuch, whoſe firſt region abounds with prave humours: for the chief parts being thereby purged from their corruption, their faculties are more operative, and apt to oppugn poyſon.</p>
                                 <p>The uſe of this Electuary hath been rare in <hi>France</hi> hitherto; but I
<pb n="624" facs="tcp:37350:371"/>hope when our emendation is better known, it will be more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent: for thus deſcribed, it is moſt efficacious for the cure of the Peſtilence; for it is a certain ſmall Theriack, which later ſedulity hath invented.</p>
                                 <p>It is very commendable,
<note place="margin">Vires.</note> both for the prevention and curation of the Plague, and all peſtilent diſeaſes: it is either given alone, or with ſome conſerve, water, or cordial decoction.</p>

                                 <p>The COMMENTARY.</p>
                                 <p>This ſolemn Antidote is cognominated from its Inventor <hi>Mithri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates</hi> King of <hi>Pontus</hi> and <hi>Bithynia;</hi> for he was a moſt generous and moſt learned Monarch, who underſtanding the Languages of twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty two Nations, and having much skill in Medicine, made this noble Antidote againſt Poyſon, whereof he was moſt afraid: by the uſe whereof, he lived long free from all virulent and deletery qualities; for being vanquiſhed by <hi>Pompey,</hi> and fearing he would lead him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live in triumph to <hi>Rome,</hi> he aſſumed Poyſon, from which he received not the leaſt trouble: but becoming weary of longer life, called one <hi>Bituitus</hi> a Souldier to him, deſiring him to kill him; whoſe ſlow and detracting trembling hand, he himſelf forced to his own ſlaughter, and ſo was ſaid to have trajected himſelf, as <hi>Appianus</hi> hath it. Amongſt his treaſuries and ſpoils, there was a Roll of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicinal Commentations found, which the King had laid up moſt ſafely, as the moſt curious of Secrets. <hi>Pompey</hi> brought theſe to <hi>Rome,</hi> and gave them to the Roman Phyſicians, as <hi>Damocrates</hi> and <hi>Andro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machus,</hi>
                                    <pb n="625" facs="tcp:37350:371"/>who approved of all the remedies, but eſpecially of the Mithridate, whoſe deſcription <hi>Damocrates</hi> rendred in Latine Verſes, that it might not be changed: and though he was not its author, but tranſcriber, yet is it cognominated from him, <hi>Damocrates his Mithri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date. Galen</hi> alſo delivers another deſcription from <hi>Andromachus,</hi> not much unlike this; but it is not ſo orderly diſpoſed, but ſomewhat depraved: for it hath an uncertain doſis of the Indian Leaf, of Gentian, Meum, and Cardamome, and Spikenard twice iterated under two appellatiors, ſignifying the ſame thing. There are fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore, many ſimples moſt convenient for this Antidote, left out, as the fruit of Balm, and its fit ſuccedany, Dittany, white Pepper, and Bdellium. It is probable, <hi>Andromachus</hi> changed the former deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, either to get ſome glory, or to vindicate it to himſelf; or elſe becauſe he found ſome ſuch an one amongſt the Secrets of <hi>Mithri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates;</hi> or elſe received it from <hi>Pompey:</hi> But however, that of <hi>Damo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> is more frequently prepared, and more celebrated.</p>
                                 <p>Neither was <hi>Nic. Praepoſitus</hi> leſs deſirous of vain-glory, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed a Pſeudo-Mithridate out of <hi>Myrepſus,</hi> congeſted of a great heap of Simples, which he, for the moſt part, deſcribed in the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous Idiome, mixed confuſedly, and diſpoſed in undue order and proportion. In brief, that Antidote hath much difficulty in its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, and little utility in its exhibition: and therefore we leave it to ſuch as will ſwear to what-ever he ſaith; and, like blinde men, will follow their blinking Author whitherſoever he leads them.</p>
                                 <p>The chief difficulty in its preparation, is the perveſtigation and ſelection of the ſimples which we often want, eſpecially ſuch of them as are exotical; in whoſe ſtead, we are forced to ſubſtitute ſuccedaneous ones; as, for the Oyl of Balm, the Oyl of Cloves or Nutmeg; for the fruit of Balm, Cubebs, or Lentisks-ſeed; for Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lernian wine, other generous wine; for Attick Honey, indigenous Honey: we have added to this out of the Roman Antidote, the root of Florentine-Orris; and for Arum, which ſome admit, and others omit, we uſe round Birth-wort; all the Gummes, Lachrymae, and Succes, ſave Gum-Arabick, and Olibanum, which ſhould be brayed, muſt be macerated in wine: in the mean while, the roots muſt be brayed, and the reſt in their order, as we have often denoted. When the Gummes are macerated, they muſt be a little fervefied, that the wine may be abſumed; then both theſe and the Powders muſt be levigated, and tranſmitted through a ſieve, and mixed with deſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Honey; and ſo an Opiate muſt be made, repoſed in a fit veſſel, and agitated once a day, for the firſt moneth, with a rudicle; in the ſecond moneth, twice a week; in the third, once a week; in the fourth, thrice of all: and ſo left, till the ſixth moneth, and then once again agitated.

                                 <p>The COMMENTARY.</p>
                                 <p>It is not without ground, that they call Mithridate the Father, and Theriack the Mother of Medicaments; ſeeing in dignity and excellency they farre exceed all others, and comprehend all others faculties; for there is ſcarce any preternatural affection, whereunto the one of theſe duly prepared doth not conduce.</p>
                                 <p>
                                    <hi>Mithridates</hi> is juſtly made the Author of both; for he invented and congeſted the matter whereof they both conſiſt: <hi>Andromachus</hi> and <hi>Damocrates</hi> diſpoſed it onely more orderly, and added ſome few things. Thus Theriack had its original from Mithridate, which <hi>Criton</hi> firſt ſo called from a Viper, which the Greeks call <gap reason="foreign">
                                       <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                                    </gap>, whoſe fleſh duly prepared, as we ſhall hereafter ſhew, <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dromachus, Nero</hi>'s chief Phyſician, added to Mithridate, and made its faculty, which before was void and imbecile, as to wild beaſts and venenate Serpents ſtings, now moſt efficacious. And thus of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thridate is made a Theriack, the moſt preſent Remedy againſt Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;
<pb n="627" facs="tcp:37350:372"/>from which, all Medicaments that extinguiſh any poyſon, are called Theriacal. <hi>Andromachus</hi> his ſedulity was very commendable, who digeſted and adorned theſe two Antidotes with good order and form, which were before without order and form: in imitation whereof, the later age hath deſcribed many Compoſitions and The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riacks, wherewith ſome Pharmacopolies are rather onerated then adorned.</p>
                                 <p>All Theriacks tradited by <hi>Rhaſis, Avicenna, Meſue, Serapio, Paulus, Oribaſius, Aetius, Myrepſus,</hi> and Neotericks, do not onely diſſent from one another, but all from the ancient one delivered by <hi>Andromachus;</hi> and therefore they are ſeldome made, but neglected as uſeleſs.</p>
                                 <p>And although the Theriack of <hi>Andromachus</hi> ſenior be deſcribed in Verſes, and ſo may not be perverted; yet that which his Son gives in Proſe, is more celebrated; which we here exhibit. However, there is no difference of moment betwixt them.</p>
                                 <p>Many things accede to this confection, which cannot be alwayes had; in whoſe ſtead, others muſt be ſubſtituted a like in firſt or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond qualities, though not in kinde; as when we make one herb ſuccedaneous to another, one ſeed to another, and one metal to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. But we uſurp ſuch ſubſtitutes as are indued with like quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, though we have not the beſt of that kinde. Thus <hi>Galen</hi> ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes Wormwood for bitter Almonds; Doves-dung for Euphorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um; Ginger for Pepper: But now adayes the Pariſian Apothecaries ſpare no coſt, in acquiring the moſt precious and rare Medicaments and Simples; and many of them, that ſcarce know their ſeconds, have all the kindes of Aromata's, Precious-ſtones, and rareſt Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples in their Pharmacopolies: yea, they ſcorn to let any Simple be unknown, that ingredes the compoſition of Medicaments.</p>
                                 <p>But if any one, as it often falls out, can neither by Art, Labour, nor Price, acquire ſome things neceſſary for confecting this Theri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ack, he may, in ſtead of Opobalſamum, which is moſt rare, ſubro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate Oyl of Cloves, or of Nutmeg; in ſtead of Coſtus, Setwel; in ſtead of Schoenantum, ſweet Cane; for Cretian Dittany, indige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous; for Amome, Acorus; for Carpobalſamum, Cubebs, or ſeeds of Lentisks; for Falernian, other generous wine. But nothing muſt be ſubſtituted for Paſtils, whoſe preparation we ſhall give in the next Section. For want of ſmall Ariſtolochy, the long may be uſed; for the Illyrian Orris, the Florentine; for Calcithis, Vitriol: which many think may be omitted, as conducing nothing to the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, but onely to the colour of the Theriack: yet if a Theriack ſhould be without that colour, its Confector would be derided for his pains. Others on the contrary hold, that it is upon good grounds admitted, becauſe by its ſtyplicity, it roborates the intrails, and by its ſiccity arceates putretude: Moreover, it is mixed in ſmall quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, and half burnt, or elſe Vitriol in its ſtead, which is burnt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally, and thence participates of little acrimony. Of old it was otherwiſe prepared: but the true manner of its confection, is that which we have given to Mithridate.</p>

                                 <p>There is no Pharmacoean novelliſt ſo ignorant, but he can boaſt of ſome ſecret Remedy he hath, for the virulent flux of ſperm, or any venereous Ulcer; concerning which affections, and their cures, Empiricks are moſt buſie: whereunto, the vulgarity of Apotheca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries frequently run, not without peril; for this kinde of people, being greedy of novelties, and too credulous, will amplect any er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, though capital, ſo it ſmell but of Medicine; and take from deceivers their moſt deletery Medicaments. It is indeed miſerable, that ſuch as are unwilling to dye, ſhould yet thruſt themſelves wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly into the hands of the killer. I would exhort all worthy A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothecaries, to move, induce, and valiantly infer war upon ſuch nefarious wretches, and uſe onely ſuch remedies as are delivered and approved by moſt perite and learned Authors.</p>
                                 <p>We deſcribe this Opiate, for the help of ſuch Youngſters as Venery hath caught: it is Invented by much Reaſon, deſcribed by much Art, and proved by much Experience; for given when and
<pb n="629" facs="tcp:37350:373"/>where it ſhould, it ſucceſsfully cures the Indian Pox, which they call the Neapolitan Diſeaſe: whence it is juſtly cognominated the Neapolitan Opiate. We have often ſeen another of the ſame name, in the Pariſian Chirurgeons hands; which being ill deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed at firſt, was daily changed by every freſh-man: for ſome one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly make it of Guaiacum, Senny, Honey, and Aqua-vitae; others adde Bayberries: ſome take away Guaiacum, and ſubſtitute Sarſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perilla; ſome approve of Hermodactyls, others Turbith, others both, and ſome neither. We exhibit it according to the preſcript eſtabliſhed and proved by Reaſon and Effect. Some adde Aqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitae; but I think Cinamon-water is more conducible: but neither, to hot waters; either, to cold ones.</p>
                                 <p>It cures the Venereous Diſeaſe: it is given every other day, and oftentimes every morning faſting, from <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g> ij. to ℥ ſs. It is moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient for ſuch, as for buſineſs cannot lye long, and ſtay much in their Cubicles.</p>

                              <p>
                                 <hi>VVE have hitherto exhibited Roboratives in form of Powders, ſoft Electuaries, and Opiates. It now reſts, before we put an end to this Book, that we explicate all Trochisks of conſimilar vertues, and all neceſſary for Pharmacopolies; as well thoſe which are compounded, that they may ingrede the confection of other Medicaments, as thoſe that are given alone, and ſerve to the benefit of no others. And leſt we ſhould have confuſedly congeſted Roborative and Purgative Trochisks together, as many do, and that perperouſly; we have adjoyned all the Cathartical, as Trochisks of Rhabarb, of Agarick, and of Alhandal, to the end of the third Section of our ſecond Book. And now acceding to the explication of Roborative and Alterative Trochisks, we ſhall begin with thoſe that conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute parts of Mithridate and Treacle.</hi>

                                 <p>The COMMENTARY.</p>
                                 <p>Theſe are called Viperine or Theriacal Paſtils; for whoſe confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, the Vipers muſt be taken about the end of the Spring, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of Summer, when they have been recreated with their wonted meat and air: The Female ſhould be rather ſelected then the Male, but not while pregnant; but agile, with a long neck, a fiery aſpect, rutilous and red eyes, a broad compreſſed head, a ſnout reflected upwards, an ample belly, a tayl not involved, grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more gracile by little and little, void of fleſh, a firm, but ſlow pace. The Males tayl grows ſenſibly more gracile, and is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute of fleſh; the trunk of its body is ſmaller, its neck thicker, its head more anguſt, with onely two canine teeth; the Female hath four. Such as inhabit ſalt and maritimous places, are not ſelegible; thoſe that are taken new, are better then the old. But that they may be rightly prepared, they ſhould be killed with Rods; for their anger being thereby incenſed, they will ſpit out their poyſon. Their head and tayl muſt be abſcinded from them when beaten, each of them to the meaſure of four fingers, which is enough in greater Vipers: thoſe, which after this amputation, move no longer, nor
<pb n="631" facs="tcp:37350:374"/>effuſe any more blood, but lye ſtill, and are exanguous, muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected as uſeleſs: The uſeful muſt be excoriated, eviſcerated, and purged from all their fatneſs, waſhed well three or four times in clear water, and then cocted in a fit pot, with ſufficient of water, with a little Salt, and more or leſs of green Dill, as the number of the Vipers is, in the prudent Apothecaries judgement; as, one handful and a half, or two, for four or five Vipers: which number will make up three ounces of Trochisks, requiſite for the confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Theriack. They muſt be cocted on a luculent, but not a violent fire, without ſmoke, that their fleſh may be eaſily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted from their ſpina; then the ſeparated fleſh muſt be brayed in a ſtone-Morter, with a wooden-Peſtel, exactly: whereunto, in pulveration, a third or fourth part of dry pulverated white-bread muſt be adjected, that ſix dragms, or one ounce of bread, may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpond to four ounces of fleſh. He that addes more bread, makes the Paſtils more imbecile; and he that addes leſs, more effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious.</p>
                                 <p>The fleſh and bread thus mixed by triture, and ſubacted into Paſte, muſt be made into Paſtils or Orbicles. They act perperouſly, who inject any of the broath, wherein this fleſh was decocted, into the triture; for ſo it becomes too humid, the Trochisks thereof too rancid, contracting filth, and not eaſie to be exſiccated: they muſt be ſmall, and compoſed with hands anointed with the Oyl of Balm, Cloves, or Nutmeg; they muſt be repoſed, dryed, and kept daily in a dry, but not an aprique place.</p>
                                 <p>They are indued with much vertue againſt the bitings of vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Animals:
<note place="margin">Vires.</note> from them the Theriack mutuates its ſo profitable a faculty, and all other things that help the Leproſie, and bitings of mad Dogs.</p>

                                    <hi>Andromachus</hi> did prudently, to write this deſcription in Verſes; for if he had done otherwiſe, it would have retained little or nothing of its priſtine integrity, ſeeing <hi>Galen</hi> is found in the deſcription, and in the defining the doſis of the Simples. <hi>Rhaſis</hi> and <hi>Avicenna</hi>

And it is more eaſie to get the deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions of the Arabian and Graecian Medicaments, then the Simples whereof they conſiſt; though they muſt be very rare, if our Pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian Apothecaries compaſs them not.

<pb n="633" facs="tcp:37350:375"/>ſoft; then their exteriour cruſt, and interiour pith, muſt be taken, waſhed, and brayed in a Morter: whereunto, a third part of the cribrated flower of white Orobs muſt be adjected, as eight ounces of Orobs, to one pound of Squills; all which, well ſubacted, make a maſs, whereof Trochisks may be formed, which muſt be dryed in the ſhade.</p>

Manlius,</hi> in ſeeking to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate the reaſon of that name to theſe Trochisks: one while he refers it to an odoriferous Herb; another while to ſome Province in <hi>France:</hi> but that Herb is fictitious, and <hi>Meſue</hi> never dreamed of <hi>France</hi> in his life: Neither is it probable did he deſign this Compoſition by the name of <hi>Gallia;</hi> for aromatical Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions are by the Arabians called <hi>Alephanginae,</hi> as conſiſting of hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Aromata's; and ſometimes by <hi>Rhaſis, Ramich;</hi> and more ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally <hi>Such,</hi> when they are compounded of Musk, Amber, Civet, and ſuch ſuaveolent things. But theſe may rather be called the ſweet Trochisks of Aloes-wood, then of <hi>Gallia.</hi> Yet I do not yield to change the name, which a whole age hath received and approved: neither will I labour in the perveſtigation of the name, where I know the thing.</p>
                                 <p>For their preparation, each muſt be brayed apart; and firſt Aloes-wood, then Amber, laſt Musk; then all muſt be received in Tragacanthum diluted in Roſe-water, and made into Trochisks, which will emit a pleaſant halite: but Pharmacopoliſts keep them more for ſanity then for ſuavity.

<pb n="635" facs="tcp:37350:376"/>in Roſe-water, till by much duction and agitation, it become like a ſmooth Unguent, without the leaſt aſperity; then muſt the Storax be added, and much diduced with the Peſtel; afterwards Xylo-aloes, Camphyr, Musk, and Amber, waſhed apart in a little Roſe-water in another veſſel, all brayed, confuſedly mixed, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted into a maſs, may be made into Trochisks, dryed in a ſhade, and repoſed in pots.</p>

That they may be duly confect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Amber muſt be mollified in a hot Morter, with a hot Peſtel, and Aloes-wood, very ſmall pulverated, added to it; then the Musk muſt be brayed alone, and laſt of all the Camphyr: all muſt be well agitated, ſubacted, and mollified, and a little Oyl, liquid Amber, or Opobalſamum ſuperadded, that they may be coacted into a more convenient maſs; whereof Paſtils may be formed.</p>

<pb n="636" facs="tcp:37350:377"/>Spikenard, Xylo-aloes, Saffron, and Cardamome, I cannot eaſily conjecture, how it can effect theſe things. I exhibit others of the ſame name, much better, more efficacious for thoſe ends, and more caſie to make, out of <hi>Myrepſus;</hi> in whoſe deſcription, I finde no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing mutable, but the order of the Simples: onely in ſtead of Spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium, if there be any ſuch thing beſides Pompholix, or the Graeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, I would rather exhibit crude Ivory then burnt, for many reaſons before-urged. The preparation is neither troubleſome nor labori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: the powder or ſcrapings of Ivory muſt be levigated apart, and alſo the other ſimples, Saffron, Camphyr, Amylum, Roſes and Liquorice; the Gummes muſt be brayed in a hot Morter, Cucu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers-ſeed muſt be decorticated, then minutely cut and levigated; then muſt they all be received in the muſilidge of Fleabane, and made into a Paſte for Trochisks.</p>

                                 <p>Various Authors give various deſcriptions of theſe Paſtils: for every one at his pleaſure addes, detracts, perverts, changes, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes deſigns the ſame Medicament with divers names, calling two or three by one word of the ſame acceptation. Beſides this of the Trochisks of Diarrhodon, or of Roſes, <hi>Meſue</hi> deſcribes others, whoſe ſignifications include others. Their reaſons are futilous, who endeavor to prove the diverſity of theſe, from the diverſity of names: But if I may, with an approved Author, ſpeak my minde, I will call theſe the Trochisks of Diarrhodon, and not of Roſes; whoſe preparation further to declare, were ſuperfluous, ſeeing it bears nothing of difficulty in it. In ſtead of Spodium, we put the vulgar Antiſpodium, which is burnt Ivory.</p>
                                 <p>They cure pituitous,

                                 <p>I have ſelected theſe Paſtils of <hi>Meſue,</hi> as moſt efficacious amongſt fifteen of that name, deſcribed by as many Authors: a great part whereof are onely nominally like theſe. They are denominated from Amber, which the Arabians call <hi>Karabe;</hi> and the Graecians <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrum;</hi> which is very good to roborate the bowels, cohibit bloody flux, and ſtay the Rheumatiſm of the Uterus. Its incraſſative fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty is augmented by the interjection of Gumme and Opium; its aſtrictive faculty by the ſhrubs of Ciſtus and Acacia; Opium is caſtigated by Saffron; the ventricle is roborated by Maſtick; all are comprehended in the muſilidge of Fleabane, and the aſperity of their parts levigated. <hi>Meſue</hi> commands many things to be burned for their preparation; but if they be admitted crude, the Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will be no worſe: for if Harts-horn or Coral have any exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mious vertue in them, it is probable they have it while crude, and not by uſtion. I am not ignorant, what uſtion conduces to Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caments, what it takes from them, or what it addes to them; onely ſome are ſo weak, that they will not indure ſuch preparation without much loſs: But let thoſe burn them that will, ſo they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their faculties with their aſhes. Acacia and Hypociſtis ſhould be firſt minutely cut, then pulverated with Pomegranate-flowers, and then the reſt: Trochisks may be made of all of them, brayed in order, and by art, with the muſilidge of Fleabane.</p>
                                 <p>They are roborative and aſtrictive:

                                 <p>Theſe Paſtils are by <hi>Bauderonius</hi> faithfully, by <hi>Joubertus</hi> depravedly deſcribed; for he changed not onely the weight of the Simples, but adjoyned others too precious, and not neceſſary. Their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition is manifold, for they conſiſt of refrigeratives, deterſives, aſtrictives, roboratives, lenitives, and ſome apertives: ſome of them are prepared by vulgar triture, pulverated ſolely by the percuſſion of a Peſtel; as the roots, woods, harder ſeeds, gummes, Bole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armeniack, and Myrrhe: yet theſe two laſt ſhould not be pulvera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted confuſedly, but apart. Some muſt firſt be cut ſmall, then brayed, and mixed with others; when they are all well brayed, they muſt be confuſedly mixed with the ſucce of Sea-onyons and Hydromel, and ſo coacted for Trochisks.</p>
                                 <p>Now for Dragons-blood, we muſt neither take <hi>Dioſcorides</hi> his Cinnabris, nor with <hi>Pliny,</hi> the blood of a Serpent, or other Animal; nor yet any thing made of Cynople, Bole-armeniack, or Sorbes and Bricks brayed and ſubacted; but the Lachryma of a certain exoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal tree called <hi>Draco,</hi> as we have taught in our Book of Simples.</p>
                                 <p>
                                    <hi>Gordonius</hi> preſcribes them to the Ulcers of the Reins;
<note place="margin">Vires.</note> and they are alſo good for the Ulcers of other internal parts; for they le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niate, deterge, allay acrimony, and roborate: One dragm exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited in Milk, much helps internal Ulcers; which, if they be in the Bladder, it muſt be diſtempered with Milk, and projected by a pipe.</p>

Whereunto, if any will adde of the Gumme of Lacca and Madder, an. <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g> j. he ſhall make them much more efficacious; and he ſhall not need Trochisks of Lacca, becauſe the Trochisks of Capers are enough, according to <hi>Plantius,</hi> for the obſtructions of the Spleen, and old affections. Both theſe and the ſuperiour are made alike. Ammoniack muſt be diſſolved in Vinegar, cocted to the conſiſtence of Honey, and therein the Powders ſubacted for Trochisks.</p>
                                 <p>They are much commended againſt all obſtructions,

                                 <p>Theſe Trochisks are very convenient for the prevention of the Plague; for a little of them detained in ones mouth, leaves a grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſapour, and an odour which arceates and emends the malign qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the inquinated air, hindring it from infecting the ſpirits: for ſuch things as are inſipid and inodorate, as Unicorns-horn, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaar-ſtone, Margarites, Precious-ſtones, and many more obſiſtents to poyſon, exert their faculties, onely when ingeſted into the body, or ſome way infuſed; which are almoſt inefficacious, if onely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the mouth, emitting no ſapour or halite, whereby the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the air may be tamed.</p>
                                 <p>But theſe Trochisks, whether they be onely detained in the mouth, or ingeſted into the ventricle, they are of eximious faculties, and moſt efficacious in evincing peſtilent poyſon. That they may be duly made, the Liquorice juyce, wherein the powders muſt be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, muſt be mollified in St. <hi>Maries</hi> Bath, till it be ducible, and may be concorporated with the whole quantity of powders; which, to the perite, will be but eaſie, though to the inexpert it ſeems too operous: who may adde thereto a little Hypocras, or ſuch conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient liquor, that he may have the Paſte ſoft for Paſtils.

The compoſition of theſe is apt, their uſe neceſſary, and none of like efficacy have been known. For their preparation, all their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients muſt be brayed apart, and then mixed confuſedly, and excepted in the ſucce of the ſeed of Fleabane, and coacted for Trochisks.</p>
                                    <p>Theſe Paſtils duly applyed,
<note place="margin">Vires.</note> drown the dolours of head and tooth-aches: they procure ſleep in the ardour of Fevers; they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh St. <hi>Anthony's</hi> fire, and inflammations; they allay the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours of all external parts.</p>

                                    <p>The Arabians enumerate theſe Trochisks amongſt Sief or Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyries. The Neotericks have very much changed their old deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption;
<pb n="644" facs="tcp:37350:381"/>for ſome have added Gumme-Arabick, others Amylum; ſome reject Opium, and ſubſtitute Camphyr: for thus the Paſtils are whiter, and more efficacious and uſeful in ocular affections; but in bitter dolours, Opium ſhould be added, or they ſhould be prepared after two manners, as <hi>Joubertus</hi> ſaith, with or without Opium, as the exigence requires; or a little Opium may be added when uſe calls for them. The preparation is ſo eaſie, as it needs no further explication.</p>
                                    <p>They are very conducible to many ocular affections:
<note place="margin">Vires.</note> for they allay their dolours, mitigate their inflammations, ſtay their fluxions, deterge, exſiccate and digeſt the matter, and roborate the part.</p>
                                    <p>Now I think I have recenſeated the moſt uſual and principal Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtils which ſhould be kept in Pharmacopolies: for others, which occurre in vulgar Antidotaries, are either of none uſe, or diſappro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; or elſe they may be eaſily comprehended under theſe, and ſupplyed by them.</p>

Whence <hi>Cornelius Celſus</hi> would have Medicaments and Potions ſeldome uſed; for ſeeing they can ſcarce be exhibited in a juſt doſis, or when exhibited, do their office, ſeeing they
<pb n="646" facs="tcp:37350:382"/>often move, but move not throughly, or propel laudable humours, deſerting the malign, or leaving the internals diſtempered: They are ſometimes pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillous; for <hi>Aetius</hi> knew an imperite MEdick, who by the undue exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Medicament, killed a man: But Topical Medicaments are ſafe, and may be uſurped, not onely to external, but internal vices. For as we ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Extuberancies appear without, uſe purges to coerceate the exuperant humours: So when we are infeſted with ſomething within, we often apply Unguents, Oyls, and Liniments without. For whether the Stomack or Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, Reins, or other interiour bowel be pained, much help may be admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred by due external applications: For all the Medicaments of old were external, which the Ancients, following their Captain Nature, uſed, without experience; and Countrey-men yet hurt with a blow, a fall, cut, or knock, without choyce aſſume the firſt occurrent Plant, and apply it to the part af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected; and it often falls out, that a noxious Medicament, upon ſtrong na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, produce ſucceſsful effects. Now we ſhall in theſe three Books, ſhew what Medicaments Topical are beſt, which ſhould be kept in Pharmacopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, and how they are made. And as we have methodically proceeded in the three former; Firſt, deſcribing the moſt liquid, as Syrupes; then the more craſs, as Eclegms; then the moſt craſs, as Electuaries; and laſt, the moſt ſolid, as Pills and Trochisks: So now, in the three later Books we ſhall begin with Oyls firſt; then paſs to the more ſpiſſe, as Unguents; and then to the moſt craſs, as Emplaiſters. Taking then our riſe from Oyls, whereof Cerates, Unguents, and Emplaiſters matuate much of their parts; we ſhall firſt treat of ſuch as are made by impreſsion or infuſion; then fly to ſuch as are made by expreſsion; and at laſt to ſuch as are elicited by aſcent or deſcent.</hi>

                           <p>The COMMENTARY.</p>
                           <p>All the Students in Pharmacy, with one conſent, follow the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates of <hi>Meſue</hi> their Captain, whom they extol with praiſes, and adore with admiration: Yet his Laws and Precepts in compound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Medicaments, cannot by duration challenge to themſelves infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility; for we ſee many of them improved, and many diſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: and it is no imprudence to recede from him, or any old Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, though they merit moſt of praiſe, when one ſees by long uſe and experience, a better and more compendious way. And thus we have ſomething detracted from, or ſomething added to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of ſome Medicaments, or their method changed. Thus they diſſent in Medicinal Oyls, made by infuſion and maceration; as in this Oyl of Violets, to whoſe confection <hi>Meſue</hi> commands the Oyl of mature Olives, and of Almonds or Seſama to be taken and waſhed; then the flowers to be macerated ſeven dayes therein, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolated and expreſſed; afterwards to be cocted three hours in a double veſſel; and this to be interated thrice, the expreſſed flowers being always abjected, and freſh ones immitted; and then to be cocted on a ſlow fire, till the watry humidity be diſſipated, and then they repoſed in a fit veſſel.</p>
                           <p>Many Apothecaries follow this preſcript; others will not ſwear to his words, but follow the dictate of their own Reaſons, and change ſome things ever and anon: for it is eaſie to adde, when a thing is invented, or detract ſomething that is ſuperfluous, or caſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate what is ill diſpoſed.</p>
                           <p>But the Oyl of Violets is now made every-where, almoſt, after this manner: Firſt, a certain quantity of ſincere common Oyl is aſſumed, verberated, and waſhed in Fountain-water, and impoſed in a glaſs, or earthen veſſel well glazened; new Violet flowers are infuſed therein, and ſo macerated a whole week, and if the ſeaſon permit, inſolated; then they are boyled a little on a ſlow fire, that they may be expreſſed; afterwards, new flowers are immitted, as before, and expreſſed; which is thrice iterated: then the flowers, after the laſt infuſion, are abjected, the Oyl cocted on a flow fire, till its aqueous humidity be diſſipated; and then it is repoſed and kept in a fit veſſel.</p>

But it is now commonly made by one or two infuſions, without any commixtion of any ſucce or decoction; the flowers being left a whole month confuſedly immerged in the Oyl before colature: but this manner is not good; for hereby the Oyl is more turbid, and its faculties weaker.</p>

                           <p>There are many ſorts of Orris, which we have enumerated in our book of Simples: the beſt whereof, is the Celeſtial Orris; next, the white or Florentine. Oyl is made by infuſion out of both, but eſpecially the former, their roots and flowers being macerated and expreſſed, as is declared: ſome take onely the roots a little bray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="650" facs="tcp:37350:384"/>and their flowers tunded, and coct them with the ſucce of other roots, and then pour Oyl upon them, and elixate them again, till all the water be abſumed; and the Oyl thus made, is very odorate and efficacious: yet it would be more efficacious, if this were twice or thrice iterated, as of old.</p>
                           <p>There is no diſſention amongſt Authors about the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the flowers to the roots, ſeeing all give twice as much flowers as roots: but they agree not about the other roots, which muſt be elixated in the water, and about the water it ſelf; nor yet about the Oyl wherein it muſt be infuſed. But leaving, for brevities ſake, the variety of opinions about this matter, we ſay, That one pound of roots muſt be taken, and cocted in four or five pounds of water at the moſt, till half be abſumed. Some adde to this definite weight of roots, flowers, and water, onely two pounds of Oyl; others, ſeven pounds and a half; and others, eight pounds: I mix five pounds, and coct them all on a ſlow fire, till the watry hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midity be diſſolved.</p>

                              <hi>Meſue</hi> calls this the complete Oyl of Roſes, becauſe it is made of Oyl of mature Olives, frequently waſhed, and the leaves of red Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes perfectly explicited, inſolated a whole week, and thrice changed, as it is in the deſcription, wherein we have given a juſt definite weight of each out of <hi>Meſue,</hi> who left all to every mans judgment &amp; will, except the water of the infuſion of the Roſes, which he equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized with the Oyl: we believe a third or fourth part will be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for the Oyl; for when it is put in more quantity, it is not eaſily reſolved by infuſion; and Oyl, by longer coction, acquires alien calour, and loſes much of its native ſuavity.

                           <p>This is called incomplete Oyl, becauſe it is made of Roſes not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely expanded, and of Oyl expreſſed from immature Olives, which is called Omotribes, crude, green, and Omphacian-Oyl; which is extracted ſolely for Medicinal uſes: in whoſe want, we ſubſtitute common Oyl waſhed in Omphacium, that it may acquire acidity, and a refrigerative faculty. The Roſes muſt be red, new, and not perfectly explicated; which muſt be purged from their white parts, brayed in a ſtone-morter with a wooden-peſtel, mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated in Oyl, inſolated a whole week, and then expreſſed: theſe Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes being abjected, other freſh ones muſt be immitted, inſolated, and expreſſed, and the Oyl extracted kept for uſe.</p>
                           <p>This Oyl refrigerates and roborates much,
<note place="margin">Vires.</note> and therefore helps ſuch diſeaſes as proceed from a hot cauſe; extinguiſhes St. <hi>Anthonies</hi> fire, allayes ardours, cohibits the flux of humours, and mitigates the heat of the ventricle and bowels.</p>

                           <p>This deſcription of Oyl of Roſes, being the moſt ſimple and eaſie to make, is moſt uſual: but they conſult their own eaſe, more then the diſeaſed's ſanity, who will not make up any Medicament, that hath to do with Art and Reaſon, though it be never ſo eaſie. And thus Apothecaries now adayes do, who take any new Roſes, though but reddiſh, and not exungulated, and macerate them forthwith in Oyl, expoſing them to the Sun in a glaſs, or figuline veſſel, by the ſpace of two months or more; afterwards, when uſe calls for them, they coct them with a little of the decoction or ſucce of Roſes, and expreſs them, and ſo repoſe the expreſſion.</p>
                           <p>Simple Oyl of Roſes hath like faculties with Omphacium,
<note place="margin">Vires.</note> but weaker: yet the greateſt part of Apothecaries uſe it both alone, and with other Medicaments; and when a Medick for an inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation preſcribes an Oxyrrhodinum, they take three parts of this Oyl, and adde a fourth of Vinegar, and ſo confect their Oxyrrho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinum, or Vinegar of Roſes.</p>

                           <p>This Oyl is made after the ſame manner with that of Violets: The Oyl, whether mature or immature, muſt be firſt waſhed; for <hi>Meſue</hi> gives neither definitively: However, the immature is more convenient and accommodate then the other; in which, the flowers of the white, not luteous Water-Lilly, muſt be macerated, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed for a Senate; then muſt the whole be a little fervefied, and expreſſed; having before received one pound and three ounces of the water of the decoction of white Water-Lilly-flowers: when all this is again iterated, and the aqueous humidity exhaled by a ſlow fire, the Oyl expreſſed is duly made, and may be repoſed for uſe. But that the decoction which ſhould be mixed therewith, may be rightly taken, four ounces of the flowers of white Water-Lillies muſt be cocted in a pound and an half of Fountain-water, till three or four ounces thereof be diſſipated; and the colature hereof muſt be mixed to the maceration.</p>

                           <p>This Oyl is of an uncertain Author: and though it be deſcribed by many, yet the proportion of the Wormwood to the Oyl, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes diverſe; ſome adding a very ſmall quantity thereof; others, a very great one: We, following the excellent method of the Pariſian Pharmacopoeans, adde five parts of Oyl to two of VVormwood, and a fourth part of its ſucce in proportion to the Oyl. Some, to make it more roborative, would have Roſes added to its confection: but we think it better as deſcribed; for VVormwood participates of ſtypticity, eſpecially the Pontian and vulgar. If any would have it more aſtrictive, he may, when uſe calls for it, mix a little Oyl of Myrtle or Roſes with it.</p>
                           <p>It calefies and roborates,

                           <p>The COMMENTARY.</p>
                           <p>As theſe two Oyls have the ſame faculties, ſo the ſame manner of confection: ſome dry the flowers of Chamomile a whole day, in a place not expoſed to the Sun; neither defining the doſis of them, nor of the Oyl. Many take an equal weight of flowers, and of their decoction, and as much Oyl as will ſerve for their due mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. Some immerge onely one pound of flowers in five pounds of Oyl, and inſolate them about half a month in the Dog-dayes; then expreſs them, and repoſe the expreſſion.</p>
                           <pb n="655" facs="tcp:37350:386"/>
                           <p>But if the judication of the good or ill mixtion and preparation be deſpumed from the power or imbecility of the Medicament, theſe Oyls will be moſt efficacious, if confected after this deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption.</p>
                           <p>Oyl of Chamomile calefies and reſolves moderately, allayes dolours ſprung from a cold cauſe, and roborates the nerves.</p>
                           <p>The Oyl of Anethum reſolves, calefies, diſcuſſes flatulency, ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borates the Nerves, takes away laffitude, mitigates the dolours of the articles, relaxates the ſpiracles of the veins, and helps in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſive fits.</p>
                           <p>The Oyl of Rue is and ought to be made after the ſame manner: Indeed <hi>Nic. Alexandrinus</hi> deſcribes a more compoſititious one, which, beſides the tund leaves of Rue, admits of ſweet Marjoram and Cumin. But it is ſeldome made for keeping; for that which <hi>Meſue</hi> gives, will potently enough effect what this pollicitates. It calefies, attenuates, digeſts, allayes the dolours of the Uterus, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from a cold cauſe, diſcuſſes flatulency, and is, according to <hi>Actuarius,</hi> accommodate to all dolours, in all parts that require ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefaction.</p>
                           <p>The Oyl of ſweet Marjoram is either ſimple, which <hi>Meſue</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of its leaves and ſucce, or of its decoction and Oyl; or elſe more compound: which, beſides theſe, admits of Myrtle-leaves, of wilde Betony, Southernwood, Water-Mint, and ligneous Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia: but this is ſcarce ever made, the former ſeldome, ſave to the confection of Melilote: and, according to <hi>Meſue,</hi> the former is made like Oyl of Myrtle; this, like Oyl of Melons or of Quinces; that is, the leaves and ſucce of ſweet Marjoram are confuſedly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerated, inſolated, expreſſed, and thrice changed in Oyl. What Sampſuchus is, and if it differs from Marjoram, we have ſhewed in our Book of Simples.</p>
                           <p>It calefies and roborates the head, and all kinde of Nerves.</p>
                           <p>Oyl of Jaſmin ſhould, by the decree of all Medicks, be kept in Pharmacopolies: for it hath moſt efficacious faculties, both in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laying dolours from a cold cauſe, and in digeſting and reſolving.

                           <p>There are three ſorts of Oyls made of S. Johns-wort; the moſt ſimple and uſual, is made of its leaves and flowers, with Oyl; the more compound admits of Turpentine, VVine, and Saffron, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides theſe.</p>
                           <p>The third and moſt compound, admits of other Oyls, Lachrymae, Succes, Roots, Leaves, and Earth-worms. The firſt is kept in Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecaries ſhops; the ſecond in Chirurgions taberns; and the third ſometimes in one, ſometimes in another, as the Medicks deſign.</p>
                           <p>The more ſimple Oyl is better, if it be made of the flowers alone macerated thrice in Oyl, inſolated, and expreſſed. Some take the Summities onely of the flowers, with its little leaves and grains; to the confection of this Oyl: which way ſoever it be made, it is very red, and as it were bloody; of a kinde of middle conſiſtence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt an Oyl and an Unguent.</p>
                           <p>It roborates the Nerves very much, deleates red ſpots, digeſts and reſolves humours, mitigates dolours, and recreates the junctures.</p>
                           <p>That which <hi>Manlius</hi> deſcribes, ſeems rather to be ſome Balſam or Unguent for agglutinating wounds, then an Oyl; yet being eximi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, we will not omit it. If the wine firſt affunded, be exhaled by the firſt ebullition, more muſt be affunded, that it may be diſſipated by the laſt.</p>
                           <p>It calefies and ſiccates, conduces very much to pricks or wounds in the Nerves: it cures burnings, helps him that hath the Sciatica, and is ſucceſsfully uſurped in all dolours contracted by cold.</p>
                           <p>The Cyprian or Lyguſtrian Oyl, which the Arabians call Oyl of Alcanna, is made like that of Rue, but it is ſeldom kept; nor yet the Oyl of Enula, of Melilote, of Carthamus, Citrian Santal, and many more, which Authors deſcribe rather out of oſtentation, then neceſſity.</p>

If you have not Apples enough in this confection, you may help out the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity with the ſucce of the roots thereof; for no ſubſtitute is ſo affine to any part of Mandrake, as another part of the ſame.

                           <p>This Oyl ſhould be made about the beginning of Autumn: we call it Myreol, or Unguent of Pigment, becauſe both the Plants whereof it conſiſts, are called by the French Pigmentum; as if they ſhould ſay, Pigment; and by ſome Ambroſia: for by the fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grance of its halite, it exhilarates; and by its aromatical lentour, inviſcates the fingers of the contrectants.</p>
                           <p>When <hi>Don Claudius Gonerius,</hi> a man of much learning and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity, of whom we have oft made mention in our Books of Medici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Matter, had accurately ſought into the nature of theſe Plants; whoſe diligence in finding the varieties and faculties of Simples, hath been very great; He was moved, that Medicks ſhould not ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrate and uſurp ſuch eximious Plants, which Nature it ſelf had deſigned excellent by their odour, ſapour, and pinguetude. But it may be theſe Plants are contemptible, becauſe of their frequency: the herb indeed grows moſt commonly in cultivated Gardens; but the ſhrub fruticates ſpontaneouſly in all places about <hi>Paris;</hi> much whereof, in the beginning of <hi>September,</hi> is brought into the City, and bought by women, to conciliate fragrance and ſuavity to their veſtments.</p>
                           <p>When I had long explored their faculties, and found them effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, I made this Oyl of them, which reſponds in faculties to many Balſams: for it conduces much to the Palſey,

                                 <hi>Meſue</hi> is too much occupied in varying the ſame Oyl: for he gives four ſorts of the Oyl of Roſes, three of Spikenard; amongſt which, thoſe onely that are firſt deſcribed, are uſurped, the reſt ſeldome or never; as other two which <hi>Myrepſus</hi> gives, ſo ſumptuous, that they rather ſeem Balſams or Unguents, then Oyls.</p>
                              <p>For the confection of this ſimple Oyl of Spikenard, in defect of Oyl of Seſamum, ſweet Oyl may be ſubſtituted, without much er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour: for <hi>Meſue</hi> ſometimes preſcribes that of Seſamum or ſweet Oyl at pleaſure. The Spikenard muſt be minutely cut, and macera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted three or four hours in a glaſs or fictile pot, in Wine, Water and Oyl; then all cocted, till the water and wine be diſſipated. Some macerate it onely in water and wine for a whole day; but ſo its faculties are worſted: they had better infuſe it for a ſhort ſpace in Oyl, water and wine, calefied a little upon the aſhes. Now half a pound of Oyl ſeeming too little for three ounces of Spikenard,

                              <p>The invention of this Oyl is attributed to the Neotericks: for none of the Ancients, that I know of, ſpeak of it. Its Author is uncertain; but whoever he was, he deſcribed this Oyl, which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imiouſly Medicinal, both legitimately and methodically: Which
<pb n="662" facs="tcp:37350:390"/>is therefore alwayes almoſt made after the deſcription we have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited; ſave by <hi>Braſſavolus,</hi> who ſtudying novelties, changed it: who, I think, is one of them that had rather be ſeen then eſtimated.</p>
                              <p>But that it may be duly confected, the roots of Cypreſs muſt firſt be minutely incided, then brayed with the barks of Capers and Tamarisks; the other ſimples alſo, as Tamarisks, Scolopendrium, or Ceterach and Rue, muſt be tunded together; only the ſeed of Agnus Caſtus apart; then all muſt be mixed together, macerated fifteen dayes in Wine, Vinegar, and Oyl; then cocted in a double veſſel, till the wine and vinegar be diſſipated; and then the Oyl ſtrained and kept.</p>
                              <p>It much helps the affections of the Spleen,
<note place="margin">Vires.</note> for it cures its hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſwelling, obſtructions, and dolours: it opens the ſpiracles and pores of the skin, reſolves humours, and diſcuſſes flatulency.</p>

                              <p>Moſt diſſent about the Author, Deſcription, Name of this Oyl, and the doſis of its ſimples: for all that have ſpoken of it, either adding or detracting ſomething, have obſcured its origine, and changed its antique deſcription; which <hi>Joubertus</hi> finding ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully depraved, caſtigated, and reduced to a better form; which here we have exhibited, under the name of Musk-Oyl: for it having two baſes, both eximious, and yet affine in faculty, it may be deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated from either: for whether we call it <hi>Muſcellinum,</hi> from Musk, or <hi>Moſcatellinum,</hi> from Nutmeg, it may legitimately bear the name. But it is fooliſhly, by ſome, called Oyl of Balanus, which is an odorate ſimple, as though it were elicited out of the brayed Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guentary Acorn.</p>
                              <p>That it may be duly made, all its ingredients muſt be brayed apart, and put together into Oyl and VVine, to be there macerated in an obturated veſſel, upon hot aſhes, for a day or two, except Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rax and Musk; then they muſt be all cocted in a double veſſel, till the wine be evaperated; then the Oyl muſt be percolated, and the pulverated Storax added to the hot colature; which muſt be again ſervefied on a ſlow fire, and at length the Musk added, and the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture kept. Some adde <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g> ij. of Musk; others <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g> iij. which, if it pleaſe rich men, let them take it; but poor men may not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs it.</p>

VVe have given a a legitimate proportion of each to other. For its preparation, the Earth-worms muſt be often waſhed in change of waters, and then in white-wine, where they may ſubſide an hour; the lotion being fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, and the wine abjected, the worms muſt be put into a double veſſel, the Oyl with red or white wine affunded, and all cocted, till the wine be evaporated; then may the Oyl, trajected through a Canvas ſtrainer, be repoſed for uſe.

                              <p>Nature takes man for her Son, whom ſhe nouriſhes, defends, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berates from diſeaſes; which ſhe abigates either by the oppoſition of contraries, or by the ſimilarity or diſſimilarity of Alexiterials. Thus the Theriack, which is in a mean betwixt the nature of man and of poyſon, cures malign, contagious, and peſtilent diſeaſes. Thus Scorpions, always to us offenſive, do not only cure the wounds themſelves inflicted, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo other venenate diſeaſes, by evoking the malign quality; out of which, by infuſion and expreſſion, <hi>Meſue</hi> makes a ſimple Oyl, conſiſting only of Scorpions and bitter Almonds, and another more compoſititious, beſides theſe admitting of Cypreſs, Ariſtolochy, Gentian, and the bark of the root of Capers. If any one, following <hi>Monardus</hi> his advice, mix Scorpions with more Antidotes, it ſhall be work worth his labour; for it is of eximious vertue againſt all poyſon and peſtilence. I have omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the deſcription of ſuch more compoſititious Alexipharmacal Oyls, becauſe the frequent deſcription of the ſame Medicament, would make a man nauſeate it. <hi>Meſue</hi> took the compound Oyl we have tranſcribed from <hi>Rhaſis;</hi> which ſhould rather be confected then the ſimple, becauſe more Medicinal and efficacious: for whoſe confection, the root of Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs, as alſo Ariſtolochy, Gentian, and the root of Capers, muſt be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutely incided &amp; contunded, then macerated in Oyl, inſolated and acted as the preſcript ſhews. <hi>Sylvius</hi> underſtands by one Kiſt of oyl, one Sex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary; but we have put one pound and a half for a more certain doſis.</p>

<pb n="666" facs="tcp:37350:392"/>invention, they are not like the genuine offspring of a perite Medick, or dexterous Apothecary: which thing, his deſcription of the Oyl of Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ſtones ſufficiently evinces; for whoſe confection, he preſcribes ℥ j. of Beavers ſtone, to be decocted in lb j. of Oyl, till the third be diſſipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, without the intervent of any wine, water, or fit decoction; which the yongeſt Apprentice would finde to be imprudence: for who knows not, that Oyl will endure a whole dayes coction without ſenſible ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, unleſs it burn? ſuch things therefore as are cocted in Oyl, molli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie not, but become hard.

But how ill doth the old deſcription of Foxes Oyl accord with theſe Laws, let its form ſpeak: for <hi>Meſue</hi> commands, that a Fox ſhould be exenterated, and then cocted integrally, both body, skin, hairs, feet and all, in Fountain and Sea-water, Oyl and Salt, till the members be diſſolved; and a little Hyſſop and Aniſe injected into the coction, and ſome more water affunded; whereas there was a pound of each ſort before. And thus you ſhould have a pot of hairs, bones, fleſh, and plants, cocted to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tretude, whoſe expreſſed pinguetude is <hi>Meſue</hi>'s Foxes Oyl. <hi>Paulus</hi> would have a Fox exenterated, and yet cocted alive, till his bones were ſeparated: but I cannot conjecture, how an eviſcerated Fox ſhould

                              <p>The COMMENTARY.</p>
                              <p>Almonds are either ſweet or bitter: Oyl is expreſſed out of both; ſometimes brayed and expreſſed with, ſometimes without their membranous Pill; ſometimes with, and ſometimes without the adjument of fire or external heat: That which is elicited without fire, is beſt. The Pharmacopoliſts therefore are to blame, that had rather be idle, then occupied in preparing Simples duly. Whence it is no wonder, that the diſeaſed complain of the rancour, acrimony, and inſuavity of the Oyl of Almonds. Now that it may be rightly confected, the Almonds to be aſſumed, muſt be new and dry, purged from both their skins, that the Oyl may be more ſincere and pure; they muſt be long tunded in a ſtone-Morter, that their oleous internal humidity may come out; they muſt be put in a bag of Horſe-hair, and then excepted in a Torcular or common Preſs, ſuch as Stationers uſe, when they cut their Books that are bound.</p>
                              <p>It ſhould be expreſſed by little and little, that it may be more pure, pellucid, and ſweet: for that which is haſtily extracted, is turbid and foeculent. It will flow more readily, if the Almonds before expreſſion be calefied by the fire or Sun; for ſo its oleagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous humidity is attenuated, melted, and made more fluxile: it erupts more eaſily, readily, and copiouſly; yea, by ſo much more readily, by how much the Almonds are hotter, if they be not burnt: but that which ſhould be introſumed at the mouth, ſhould be elicited without fire.</p>
                              <p>Almonds are purged two wayes: Firſt, they muſt be macerated long in warm water, and then compreſſed with ones fingers, that the cortex may cleft: Secondly, they may be put in ſome Frying<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pan, with a ſmall quantity of flower, and agitated with ones hand over a ſlow fire, till the Involucrum diſrupt, which will afterwards come eaſily off by rubbing; which ſecond way is better then the firſt: for macerated Almonds, unleſs they be well dryed before their triture, will effund aqueous Oyl. One pound of Almonds will emit ſix ounces of Oyl; and a brayed Magma, irrigated with water, and calefied upon the aſhes, till the water be diſſipated, and then preſſed, will emit as much: but this will be more foeculent, and fit onely for Liniments, Unguents, and External Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                              <p>Oyl of Almonds is commended to many uſes:
<note place="margin">Vires.</note> for it conduces to the tabid and conſumed, refecting the macilent body, with humid, viſcid, fat, and aereous aliment: it leniates the aſperity of the throat, of the lungs, and other parts; if injected, it allayes the heat of the Uterus, and of the Bladder; if it be applied as an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guent, is perduces rough places to equality, erugates the skin, mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifies hard lumps, and emends the ſiccity of all the Junctures, and other parts.</p>

                              <p>THe Oyl of bitter Almonds is educed alſo by expreſſion, though <hi>Alexandrinus</hi> makes it by infuſion: for he macerates two pounds of purged brayed Almonds three dayes in five pounds of Oyl, and afterwards cocts them to the half, and expreſſeth the Oyl. But nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Oyl, nor the manner of its confection, is good: For <hi>Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xandrinus</hi> erres, in thinking that Oyl can be cocted to the half; for it will rather burn, then diſſipate like water. Beſides, the Oyl thus drawn by infuſion, is not half of it Oyl of Almonds; it is not ſo ingrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, nor yet ſo eximious as by expreſſion. It is therefore better to draw pure and ſincere bitter Oyl out of bitter Almonds, by triture and expreſſion: which Oyl is much commended; for it ſolves ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, diſſipates flatulency, allayes the dolours of the nerves, mollifies hardneſs, deleates the Pimples of the face, and cures the tinkling of the ears.</p>
                              <p>For it calefies, incides, digeſts, and deterges potently:
<note place="margin">Vires.</note> wherefore it helps ſuch as have the Stone, Strangury, breathe difficultly, and are Splenatick: it cures many vices of the skin, kills worms; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſſumed, it helps the coldneſs of the Uterus; being applyed, it cures difficulty of breathing, and hardneſs and dolour in the nerves from a cold cauſe.</p>
                              <p>The Oyl of Peach-ſtones is educed after the ſame manner; which having the ſame or like faculties, is not made.</p>

Thus Wine is left to Vint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and Bread to Bakers: Thus alſo common Oyl, Oyl of Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuts, and Seſamum, are left to ſervants to expreſs, who uſed in Hand-mills or fit Preſſes, to grinde ſeeds, and expreſs plenty of Oyl for nutriment to bodies, or to lamps, for the cuſtody of ſanity, or cure of diſeaſes. Theſe Oyls therefore are ſeldome made in Phar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macopolies. But becauſe the Oyl extracted from Walnuts by Ruſticks, is inſuave and turbid, it were better that Apothecaries would extract that which they uſe; for ſo it would be more limpid, ſuave, and efficacious.</p>
                              <p>It is of much uſe: for it reſolves craſs humours,

<pb n="670" facs="tcp:37350:394"/>by its digeſtive and ſiccative faculty, it cures the punctures and fores of the nerves. It heals burnings by a ſpecial propriety; it is indued with the ſame vertue that Oyl of Acorus hath; for by the tenuity of its ſubſtance, its reſolvative faculty and heat, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves flatulent matter.

                              <p>AS all men follow not one Law and Rule in Life; ſo neither are all taken with one courſe of Medicaments: for as the old Verſe hath it;
<q>Utitur ingenio patria quaeque ſuo:</q> Some admit of a Medicament, others reject it; ſome approve of none but new inventions, others of none but old ones: and though both this and that troop be my friends, yet Reaſon is my neareſt friend, which I have in writing and acting made my Rule. I adore <hi>Meſue</hi> in moſt things; yet in ſome I leave him to thoſe he wrote to, leaving ſome of his Medicaments to ſuch as he left them to, as appears by the Catalogue of Medicaments contained in this our Shop. He deſcribes ſome Oyls which are not uſed; yet he will not omit them, becauſe their faculties are above contempt: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we ſhall treat in brief.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>Meſue</hi> ſaith, that the Oyl of Filberds allayes the dolours of the nerves and articles: it is made as the Oyl of Almonds. A Filberd is a ſmall Nut, in Greek <gap reason="foreign">

                                 </gap>, ſometimes called the Pontian or Praeneſtine Nut, from the places where the Plant grows copiouſly, whoſe oleous humidity is adonynous, diſcuſſes humours, and is thence fit for the ſaid affections.</p>
                              <p>The Oyl of Apricot-ſtones mitigates the dolour of the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the Haemorrhoids, and digeſts the tumours of thoſe parts, and Ulcers. It is made after the ſame manner with the former. Theſe ſtones are taken out of ſome Apples, which from the place where they are, are called Armeniacks; from their colour, Golden Apples; and from their ſpeedy maturity, Praecocks: Their carno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity is very ſapid and ſweet, but their kernels ſharp, bitter, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful.</p>
                              <p>The Oyl of Peaches kills worms, removes obſtructions, allayes the dolours of the ears, benefits the tumid and dolourous Hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrhoids. Furthermore, it calefies, attenuates, reſolves, and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects the ſame with Oyl of bitter Almonds: for the ſtones of Peaches, whereof it is made, are bitter, calefactive, and diapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical.</p>

                              <p>The Oyl of Kerva or great Spurge diſcuſſes craſs flatulency, atte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuates viſcid phlegm, cures the dolours of the belly and inteſtines, proceeding from that humour, and helps the Hydroptical, whether it be aſſumed or applyed. <hi>Avicenna</hi> recenſeates more of its utilities; but it is very ſeldome made.</p>
                              <p>The Oyl of wild Saffron, incides and deterges, thence it cures the Jaundice, the dolour of the breaſt, lungs and ventricle, from a cold cauſe. But this is not oft made.</p>
                              <p>The Oyl of Piſtack-Nuts, and Pine-Apples, leniates the aſperity of the throat, mitigates the dolour of the breaſt, cures the Cough, fattens the macilent and tabid, and augments Sperm: but they are better for eſure.</p>
                              <p>And that I may in brief ſpeak of many things, Oyls may at any time be confected of Cherry-ſtones, Unguentary Acorn, Orange, and Lemmon-ſeeds, and the four cold ſeeds, and the like, which will have the ſame faculties that their fruits, ſeeds and ſtones, whereof they are confected, have.</p>

                              <p>THe Oyl of Nutmeg is ſtomachical, aromatical, and ſweet; for it roborates the weak ſtomack, cheriſhes its faint heat, moves appetite, helps coction, cocts cold humours, reſolves hot ones, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipates flatulency: it is made of Nutmegs brayed, calefied, and preſſed; which emit Oyl, which at firſt is liquid, and concretes afterwards into the ſolidity of an Unguent.</p>
                              <p>But becauſe Nutmegs are very precious, and their Oyl is better new then old; it ſhould be confected but in ſmall quantity, and as exigence calls for it, iterated.

                              <p>PEtreol is the work and effect of Natures hand, not of the Apothecaries; for he onely collects it, or buys, keeps and uſes it when collected: for Nature confects it in the bowels of the Earth, and it eructates out of the clefts of Rocks; whence it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Petreol, or Rock-Oyl.</p>
                              <p>It is to be had in thoſe Regions where Bitumen is, whereunto it is related: for Bitumen is either denſe or liquid; the denſe, is as it were the fatneſs of the earth, which ſwims upon the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and by agitation of the winds, is caſt upon the ſhore, and there concretes, and becomes tenacious and denſe.

                              <p>Bitumen then is of large comprehenſion: to whoſe family, many refer Piſſaphaltus and Mumy. However, Piſſaphaltos is a kinde of mixture made of Pitch and Aſphaltos, or denſe Bitumen, which is uſed in maritimous towns, to Pitch Ships withall. The Arabians call Piſſaphaltus, <hi>Mumy,</hi> which in their Language denotes Balm: in ſtead whereof, the Syrians and Arabians of meaner fortune, uſed Piſſaphaltos, in embalming their dead carcaſes. And thus they take Piſſaphaltus for Balm, and Balm for Mumy, which agree not ſo much as in name: for natural Balſam or Balm, is Opobalſamum; artificial, conſiſts of many Aromata's, uſed in conditing Kings bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. Piſſaphaltos, is a certain mixture of Pitch and Aſphaltos: Mumy is a thing ariſing from one or both of them, and the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tretude of a carcaſe: whoſe illicite uſe now to proſecute and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove, appertains not to our purpoſe; whereunto, I ſhall now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn.

                              <p>THe Guaiacum muſt be brayed, put in a Cucurbite of glaſs or earth, with a ſtrait orifice, which muſt be obduced with a plate of Tinne full of holes, and thruſt into the more patent orifice of another Cucurbite, and both well joyned and circumlited with tenacious argil, paſte or clay; then muſt the empty veſſel be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into a hole, and buried in the earth, ſo that the earth may touch the middle of the Cucurbite, which contains the wood of Guaiacum; and then a fire muſt be accended all about it, and Oyl will diſtil from the ſuperiour into the inferiour.</p>
                              <p>Thus are the Oyls of Juniper, Ivy, Aſh, and many more woods, berries and roſines, educed.</p>
                              <p>This Oyl of Guaiacum is truly alexiterial to the French Pox:
<note place="margin">Vires.</note> for a few drops thereof taken in a morning on a jejune ſtomack, with water, or ſome fit decoction, deleate the venereous Puſtuls, allay the night-tormenting dolours, accelerate the Ulcers ſanity, and extinguiſh the malignant quality of this affection.</p>

                              <p>A Boccia muſt be filled with the tunded wood and barks of Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marisks, its orifice muſt be occluded with a foraminous plate, and it ſelf ſo placed in the ſuperiour part of the furnace, that its belly looking upwards, may be with clay well conjoyned to the top of the furnace; and its orifice tending downwards, and trajecting it ſelf through the upper room of the furnace, may be committed to the orifice of the inferiour Boccia, that ſo Boccia may be ſet againſt Boccia; then the inferiour one muſt be ſetled on a Trivet, that it may ſtand immoveable; the fire muſt be built, and accen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded about the ſuperiour Boccia, that the matter within it may ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefie, and exude its Oyl into the inferiour, which is recipient.</p>
                              <p>This way is like the former; onely the inferiour Boccia is not buried in the earth, but placed on an Iron; and the ſuperiour is as it were ſuſpended, its orifice protending it ſelf below the chamber of the furnace, and its belly looking up; out of which, the Oyl li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quefied by the fire, wherewith it is circumcinged, delabes into the inferiour receptacle. <hi>Wekerus,</hi> in the third Book of his <hi>General An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidotary,</hi> gives an effigies hereof; after which, others may be formed.</p>
                              <p>The Oyl of Tamarisks conduces much to Splenatick affections;
<note place="margin">Vires.</note> for it reſpects and roborates that part by a ſpecial propriety; it prepares melancholical humours for ejection; it mitigates its quality, it opens, attenuates, diſſolves, removes obſtructions, and diſcuſſes flatulency.</p>

Now this eduction is effected two wayes; either by an Alembick, or by Inclination: which later way is, in proper ſpeaking, neither by aſcent nor deſcent, but participates of both. To the diſtillation made by an Alembick, a ſtraight Cucurbite is required, whereon the roſtrated Alembick may reſide: the Alem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bick ſometimes in ſtead of a beak, portends out of its head a certain Pipe, long and crooked, with turning gyres like a Serpent: whence it is called an Intort or Worm. The neck of the Alembick ſhould be long and gracile, if the matter to be diſtilled be ſmall and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuious; but ſhort, and more patent, if the matter be craſſer: and ſeeing it muſt be often changed and renovated, an Urinal will be apter then a Cucurbite.</p>
                              <p>Sometimes Sand, Salt, or the like, is added to the matter to be diſtilled, when it fervefies and aſcends eaſily.</p>

Now diſtillation is either dry or moiſt: the dry diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation is made in a furnace, ſometimes by the intervent of Coals, ſometimes of Sand, and ſometimes of hot aſhes; the humid is made in St. <hi>Maries</hi> Bath.

                              <p>Vitriol affords many ſeveral Medicinal Remedies; as, Spirits, Oyl, both acid and ſweet, Salt, Colchotar, and a certain thing the Chymiſts call Balſam. The Spirit of Vitriol differs from its Oyl, in its preparation, tenuity, and active vertue: for it is the more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile liquor of Vitriol; or, that I may ſpeak in their own language, the quinteſſence thereof; which is made after many manners, as thus: The Vitriol is agitated very much with the vehement heat of the fire, within its ſtraight Vial, ſo that that which diſtils upon the pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verated earth (which they call Colchotar) is alwayes reſunded, and at length, by the vehemency of the fire, propelled through the crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed glaſs: and this is the moſt efficacious Spirit. Some diſtil water and Oyl together out of the beſt Vitriol, which are craſſer Spirits; which they purge from their dregs, till they be attenuated into ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiler Spirits. But they are better elicited, while they are driven through a new Alembick, by affunding the extillatitious liquor al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes upon the dead head, and then circulating it a whole week.</p>
                              <p>The common Oyl of Vitriol, is educed after this vulgar manner: A certain quantity of natural and good Cyprian Vitriol is taken, calcinated in a veſſel of Copper, till it be quite red, and its phlegm diſſipated; then it is brayed and included in a Cucurbite, obduced with clay, irrigated with Aqua-vitae, and ſo left for a day; then it is collocated, and ſetled in a furnace duly ſtructed, and at firſt a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorate, then a vehement fire accended under it, that all its liquor may extil: which after refrigeration, is put in a ſmall Cucurbite coarctated with a capitel; and ſo its aqueous liquor ſtills in S. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> Bath, and its pure Oyl remains in the bottome of the veſſel: which is again put into another Cucurbite, circumcinged with ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended fire, that it may be better and more throughly purged. Its colour is more or leſs red or white, as its efficacy and calour is more or leſs moderate. ℥ iij. of Oyl may be elicited out of lb j. of rube<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Vitriol.</p>
                              <p>All the qualities of the Oyl of Vitriol are ſo intenſe,
<note place="margin">Vires.</note> that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be aſſumed alone, but mixed with ſome water, decoction, or fit conſerve: and though it be exceeding hot, yet a few drops there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of mixed with much water, become acid, and both grateful and uſeful to the Feveriſh. It penetrates by its tenuity, carries the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to remote parts, removes obſtructions, arceates putretude, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creates the bowels, and conduces much to the Peſtilence, Epilepſie,
<pb n="681" facs="tcp:37350:399"/>Palſey, and Strangury. It doth not infect the ſimple decoction of Roſes, but the Syrupe of Violets, with a purpureous and elegant acid ſapour; for a few drops thereof caſt into an ounce of the ſaid Syrupe, will make it from violaceous, purpureous.</p>

Medicks alſo too licentiouſly, though not improperly, name ſome craſs and red Liquors, confected with much art and mixture, and indued with eximious faculties, Balſams: but they ſhould be rather called Antibalſams, or Balſameols; which name they mutuate for Turpentine, which is as it were the Baſis from which all Aromatical and Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinous Mixtures, which are analogous to Balſams, have their odours, colours and faculties.

                              <hi>UNguents were of old in ſuch uſe and fame, that he that handled or ſold them ſolely, or them and other Medicaments, was called an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guentary and Myropoliſt. The Arabians often call Cerecloths and Salves, Unguents: as</hi> Dioſcorides <hi>doth many odorate Oyls; according to that of</hi> Hippocrates, <hi>A Medick ſhould be Unguented, that is, Perfumed, that by the fragrant halite of his veſture, he may purchaſe glory amongst the vulgar. But now Unguents are in a more anguſt acceptance, taken onely for thoſe Medicaments which adhibited and illited onely on external parts, are thought to auxiliate them, when other Medicaments would either through their gravity burthen them, or through their humidity hurt them; and are olaginous, of a middle conſiſtence, betwixt a Cerecloth and a Liniment, as a Cerecloth is betwixt an Unguent and a Salve. Now the proportion of Oyl in the confection of an Unguent, is ſuch, that one ounce thereof reſponds to each dragm of Powder, and two dragms of Wax: So that there is four times as much Oyl as Wax, and eight times as much Oyl as Powder. And ſeeing heat makes the conſiſtence of an Unguent ſofter, and cold harder, Myropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts uſed to mix more Oyl in Winter, and leſs in Summer, with their ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients. Now ſeeing there is much conformity betwixt a Cerecloth and an Unguent, both conſiſting of the ſame Materials, onely differing in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; the Unguent receiving more Oyl and leſs Wax, that it may be of a middle conſiſtence betwixt a Liniment and a Cerecloth, more ſpiſſe then the one, and more liquid then the other: We have determined to treat of them both in this Book: In whoſe firſt Section we ſhall deſcribe the moſt approved
<pb n="690" facs="tcp:37350:404"/>and uſual Unguents; in the ſecond, Cerecloths. Now Unguents are either made with fire, as thoſe that admit Wax, Roſines, and decoctions of Simples; or without fire, as ſuch as need onely nutrition and ſubaction, as the crude Unguent, and the Unguent of Quickſilver; of which we ſhall in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar treat in this Book, beginning with the Refrigerative: The firſt whereof that occurs, is the Unguent of Roſes.</hi>

                           <p>The COMMENTARY.</p>
                           <p>That this Unguent may be duly confected, the Hogs-greaſe ſhould be accurately purged from its membranes, nine times waſhed in warm water, and nine times in cold, that it may depoſe all its odour; for ſo it will be more apt to receive any odour, and eaſily admit of the fragrance of Roſes. Now the maceration of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes ſhould be iterated, that they may be more efficacious: half as much of their ſucce, and the ſixth part of as much of the Oyl of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds, as there is of greaſe, ſhould ingrede the colature, according to <hi>Meſue.</hi> But to three pounds of Hogs-greaſe, we put a pound and an half of the ſucce of Roſes, and half a pound of the Oyl of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds. Some, in ſtead of the Oyl of Almonds, put the Oyl of Roſes or Omphacinum; but then the Unguent will not open the pores of the skin, nor permeate ſo quickly. It may be made without any Oyl, ſeeing it is liquid enough of it ſelf: and thus, almoſt, all Myropoliſts make it. But it is better to have it too liquid with the Oyl of Almonds, then too craſs without it: And as it is againſt the Rules of Art, that all the quantity of Oyl which <hi>Meſue</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes, ſhould be taken; ſois it contrary to right Reaſon, that all ſhould be refuſed.</p>
                           <p>Some, to acquire a greater redneſs, and more elegant colour, whereof Aromataries are moſt ſtudious, mix Alcanet-root with the coction: but it were much better to mutuate that colour from Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, then other irrequiſite ſimples.</p>

                              <hi>Meſue</hi> would have Opium diluted in Roſe-water, accede its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, that it might withall conciliate ſleep to the interruptly vigilant: whereunto I willingly aſſent, and wiſh, that Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caries
<pb n="691" facs="tcp:37350:404"/>would confect, if not all, yet part of this Unguent with O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pium.</p>
                           <p>It extinguiſhes immoderate heat, inflammations, pimples, and S. <hi>Anthonies</hi> fires: it allayes the dolours of the head from a hot cauſe: it mitigates the ardour of the Ventricle, Reins, and Liver: that which admits Opium, effects all theſe more validly; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides conciliating of ſleep, cures Phrenſie, and refects ſtrength.</p>
                           <p>Unguents of Violets, Water-Lillies, and other flowers, of all qualities, may be confected after the ſame manner.</p>

                           <p>This Unguent conſiſts of few things, and is deſcribed alike by few Authors. VVe conjecture, that the variety of its deſcriptions ariſes from this, That <hi>Rhaſis</hi> its author gave not the doſis of the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples definitely, and therefore every one augments, diminiſhes, and changes them at his own will. Some, rather deſiring the grace of odour themvertue, adject Camphyr; others the ſucce of Tragacan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thum: ſome Lithargie; others the whites of Egges: ſo that its deſcription is nowhere certain, but at <hi>Paris,</hi> where all the Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caries make it after this; who ſo rub the Ceruſe on the ſetaceous ſieve, that it will go thorow; then they waſh it often in common water, afterwards in Roſe-water; then they dry it, and after ſicca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, rub it to powder, which they mix with wax melted in the Oyl of Roſes, and by agitation with a Spatle, reduce it into an Unguent of a white colour, and legitimate conſiſtence, which is indued with much vertue; for it cures the Itch, Scab, Aduſtion, Galling,

                           <p>This is one of thoſe Unguents which are depraved by each Artiſt, becauſe of the indefinite doſis of the ſimples whereof it conſiſts: for <hi>Meſue</hi> preſcribes onely to this preparation, That ſometimes Oyl, ſometimes Vinegar and Lithargie, accede, which ſhould be well laboured in a Morter: yea, many to this day neither limit the
<pb n="693" facs="tcp:37350:405"/>quantity of Oyl nor of Vinegar, butonely deſcribe as much as will ſuffice; others take equal parts of both, and as much Lithargie; others, and that better, take one pound of Oyl, half a pound of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thargie, and three ounces of Vinegar: We have given a due pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of each; yet if the Myropoliſt in its agitation finde one thing too little or too much, he may at his judgement change it. Now this Unguent ſhould be continually agitated with a Peſtel, till it acquire a fit ſpiſſitude. Much of Oyl or Vinegar muſt not at firſt be affunded on the Lithargie, leſt it be ſubmerged, and never be able to attain an Unguentary conſiſtence. Some agitate it in a plumbeous Morter, with a plumbeous Peſtel, that it may be more deſiccative: but this obſcurer tincture many like not in Unguents; others waſh Lithargic in Roſe-water: ſome adde the ſucce of Nightſhade with Ceruſe; but it is beſt to prepare it after the form given, which the Pariſian-Apothecaries follow: yet all need not at all times to take Oyl of Roſes, but, without errour, ſometimes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Oyl. It is called the crude Unguent, becauſe it is made with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fire; the nutritum, becauſe with much nutrition it acquires an Unguentary form; ſometimes the Triapharmacal, from the union of the three ſimples whereof it conſiſts: of which, duly cocted, may be made a ſalve, that ſhould be kept in all ſhops, as moſt uſual.</p>

                              <hi>Guido Cauliacus</hi> gives the ſame or like deſcription, which, they ſay, he diſcerped from the ninth Book of <hi>Galens</hi> ſimples: but I evolving that Book, finde no ſuch thing. But whoever was its Author, it is a Medicament very expetible by Chirurgeons. The preparation of this and of the precedent, is one; and both being made without fire, may be called Crude Unguents.</p>
                           <p>It is refrigerative, aſtrictive, and roborative; very convenient for the beginnings of fluxions, and therefore hinders the eruption of Pimples, Inflammations, and the like.</p>

                           <p>Whilſt I was writing theſe things, there came a Ruſtick to ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore my help for a Kinſman of his, who being continually peſtred with a paſtulous Itch, and had been forced to buy a Remedy of a Barber-Surgeon; the Barber ſold him a familiar Unguent made of Mercury, Sulphur, and Swines-greaſe, wherewith he anointed his body once or twice: but the Unguent did ſo violently move the Colluvies of his whole body towards his neck and throat, that by violent ſuptation, the man was almoſt ſuffocated. I will recenſeate no more ſuch ſtories: for hence it ſufficiently appears, what errour the imperite are hurried into, while they unhappily preſcribe a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niment confected of Quickſilver and Fat, or Butter and Sulphur. But leſt they again run into the like folly, or for want of others, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe ſuch dangerous ones, we give this Unguent, which is eaſie to make, and moſt efficacious in curing the Itch; for it mitigates bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious humours, and ſharp and ſalt phlegm: it moderates all calid humours, and cures the itchy Scab.</p>

                           <p>It can ſcarce be credited, to how many and great diſeaſes and ſymptomes the eye is obnoxious: for the oppugning whereof, many kindes of Medicaments are profitable; but the forms of all are not idoneous; for the eyes will not tolerate any, ſave Collyries and Unguents: for Cataplaſms, Salves, and the like, may ſometimes profit, when applied to the Eye-lids; but immitted into the Eye, they would blinde it. This Ophthalmical Unguent, ſo called from its effect, arceates the fluxions of humours, temperates their heat,
<pb n="697" facs="tcp:37350:406"/>mitigates their acrimony, ſtayes and dryes away tears, allayes do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, takes away redneſs, and roborates the Eye, if after its univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal remedies, purgation and phlebotomy, it be adhibited to the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles of the Eyes and Eye-lids.</p>

                                 <hi>Rondeletius</hi> finding this Unguent in <hi>Praepoſitus</hi> his Antidotary, in many things reprehenſible; ſome things he detracted, others he ſubſtituted; others he diſallowed of, as inaccommodate to that purpoſe; and the whole Compoſition he much changed: for in ſtead of white wax, he puts flave; in ſtead of Oyl of Violets, the Oyl of Almonds: but he expunges the ſucce of Tragacanthum, Gum-Arabick, and Quinces-grains, as inconvenient by their aſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive vertue to digeſt humours. But if in reſolving the principles of Diſeaſes, ſome Roboratives be requiſite; when uſe calls for this Unguent, a little Oyl of Quinces, or Omphacium, or the like, as occaſion requires, may ſoon be mixed therewith. Now that it may be more digeſtive, the ſucce of Foenugreek is added thereto, though
<pb n="698" facs="tcp:37350:407"/>in ſmall quantity, becauſe its odour is inſuave. If the Marrow of Calves-bones be adjected, it will be more emollitive and laxative, according to <hi>Fernelius.</hi> That it may be duly made, the wax firſt cut into pieces, muſt be melted with the Oyl; then the Butter and Greaſes: when all are melted, Oeſypus muſt be added to them, and all agitated with a rudicle; then they may be taken from the fire, and the ſucces extracted firſt in common, or, as ſome ſay is better, in Roſe-water, muſt be mixed with them, and all moved with a ſtick, till they acquire a due ſpiſſitude.</p>
                              <p>This Unguent leniates the dolours of the Breaſt, cocts the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours that cauſe coughing, moves ſpittle, helps the pleuriſie, reſolves the uſeleſs and noxious humours that adhere to the Muſcles of the Breaſt, and relaxates, leniates, and mollifies the parts.</p>

Yet I think theſe ſo neceſſarily requiſite, that he that expunges them, expunges much of the odour and vertue of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicament.

                              <p>This Medicament is from its prepollent faculty in cocting and ſuppurating humours, called the Baſilical or Regal Unguent: which, when it conſiſts onely of four Simples, is called Tetrapharmacum, or leſſer Baſilicum; when of more, the greater Baſilicum: both of them are Diapyetical, or ſuppurative; but the ſimple one is more imbecile, and leſs calid, then the more compoſititious: wherefore, being temperate, it is more idoneous for cocting and ſuppurating humours. For the temperate Medicament is truly pepaſtical and maturative, having more cognation with our native calour: whence <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith, It rather acts by quantity then quality; whereas Reſolva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, being more valid, work more by quality then by quantity, not abſuming ſuperfluous humours. Seeing then that this Tetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pharmacum is as it were ſymmetral, it muſt needs be the beſt ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puratory; and by cocting humours, rightly convert them into ſlimy matter, juſt as the temperate palm of a mans hand, moved long on any part abounding with prave humours.</p>
                              <p>Roſine and black Pitch, which hath not yet been uſed in pitching ſhips, muſt be melted with Oyl, and when cold, agitated with a Peſtel into the conſiſtence of an Unguent.</p>

                              <p>Seeing vulgar Diſpenſatories afford no eximious Mundificative, reſponſible to Chirurgeons mindes in deterging Ulcers, we have for their ſakes concinnated this rhyptical or exterſive Medicament, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with ſuch faculties, as <hi>Galen</hi> requires, Reaſon calls for, and Uſe approves of to that end: For ſeeing ſuch a Medicament ſhould by the tenuity of its ſubſtance, and its exſiccative faculty, exterge the Ulcer, and ſeparate the filth from the part whereunto it is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited; one that is emplaſtical and viſcid, aggeſting and cohibit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the excrements and filth within the Ulcer, is much diſtant from ſuch. But the vulgar Mundificatives, being for the moſt part made of Sarcocolla, Frankincenſe, and Maſtick; and ſometimes of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſine, Comfrey, and Houſe-leek, are ſo farre from cleanſing Ulcers, that they much defile them. Let then this our rhyptical Unguent, which will effect what it pollicitates, be kept in ſhops, and the reſt ejected.</p>
                              <p>It receives burnt River-crabfiſhes, which are eximious in exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging and exſiccating: The River-crabfiſhes ſhould be ſelected; but in defect thereof, Sea-crabs may be aſſumed. They muſt be burned on a red-hot Platter, till they may be eaſily levigated; their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der muſt be mixed with the powders of the other ſimples brayed apart; then muſt all be incorporated, agitated, and united into an Unguent of juſt craſſitude.</p>
                              <p>It abſumes the watry,
<note place="margin">Vires.</note> ſeparates the craſſer, and exterges all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours from the Ulcer: yet ſuch as are conſpurcated with craſſer corruption, and cadaverous fleſh, require a more valid and cathare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Deterſive. However, this by a peculiar and eximious faculty, cures wounds inflicted by mad Dogs, extinguiſhes their virulency by a ſpecifical propriety, and exterging, ſiccating, and abſuming their infected humours.</p>

                                 <hi>Praepoſitus</hi> diſcerpted this deſcription from <hi>Myrepſus,</hi> who hath ſuch an Unguent in the end of his third Section; who, that he might ſeem the firſt Author, added Oyl, Wax, Salt, and Turpentine, and made it more efficacious: yet before this adjection, <hi>Myrepſus,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of its admirable faculties, called it, The wonderful Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guent.</p>
                              <p>Pharmacopoliſts make it moſt uſually after the greater deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, as more ſecure then the ſimple one; though both of them are averſe to Nature, becauſe of the Quickſilver: yet its extinction by ſpittle, or the ſucce of Lemmons, may excuſs all fear from their mindes. Moreover, Turpentine and Swines-greaſe are added thereto; which would obſcure its ferity, if any remained. Some put Sulphur in ſtead of Quickſilver; others the ſucce of Fumatory, or Lemmons: ſome, to the confection of this Unguent, onely bray the root of Enula in Vinegar, and traject it through a ſieve; but it is better to coct it to putrelage, in two pounds of Vinegar, and two pounds of water, rather then in Vinegar onely, for ſo it is too acrimonious.</p>
                              <p>Let the greaſe therefore be added to the wax, melted in Oyl, and afterwards adde the pulp of Enula, then the Quickſilver, Salt, and Turpentine; which mix together, agitate, and ſubact into an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guent.</p>
                              <p>It is very efficacious in curing the dry and moiſt Scab from what cauſe ſoever, and other foedities of the skin.

                              <p>They ſay <hi>Avicenna</hi> both invented and denominated this Unguent; and yet he neither knew the number of the Apoſtles, nor worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped God in that way: for ſuch as follow Gods Laws, and know him truly, know thus much for certain, that the Apoſtles cured the diſeaſed by words, and the very ſhadow of their veſtures, and not by Unguents. Whence I eaſily believe, that the Interpreters of the Arabian Tongue erred, in rendring this Unguent, which <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vicenna</hi> calls <hi>Alhauarim,</hi> The Apoſtles Unguent. But whoever im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed this Nomenclature, I will not diſallow of it; for it deſigns a Compound of ſo many Simples as there were Apoſtles: which is thus made:</p>
                              <p>Firſt the Gummes are macerated twelve hours in Vinegar; then ſtrained, and cocted on a ſlow fire, to the ſpiſſitude of Honey; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, whilſt hot, Turpentine ſhould be diluted: in the mean-while, the Lithargie ſhould be levigated in Oyl, and nutrited on a ſlow fire; in which, the Wax and Roſine muſt be melted: with which, after ablation from the fire, the Gummes duly prepared muſt be injected; then Ariſtolochy, Myrrhe, and Frankincenſe; and at length Ruſt; whoſe dofis many imperitely augment, that they may make the Unguent more green: but it acquires more vehement acrimony, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with its colour, and thence becomes too mordacious and noxious.</p>
                              <p>It expurges wounds and contumacious Ulcers by deterſion, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes dead fleſh, and accelerates the reſtitution of new fleſh.</p>
                              <p>The Unguent of Chalk ſeven or ten times waſhed in common wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and then in Roſewater, and excepted into a ſufficient quantity of Oyl, and redacted to the craſſitude of an Unguent, doth very much agree with this in quality; for it efficaciouſly exterges corruption
<pb n="704" facs="tcp:37350:410"/>from Ulcers, abſumes humidity, and heals them. There is another more compoſititious Unguent of this ſort made, whereunto they adde Ceruſe, Pompholyx, Lithargie, Calves-fat, and the Unguent of Roſes; but it is ſeldome in uſe.</p>

                              <p>That all Aegyptians were Medicks, is now a Proverb; and that the firſt Laws of curing, and many Medicaments, were deduced from them, their ancient Writings and Monuments atteſt. But the Greeks, alwayes covetous of glory, have ſo craftily changed what they borrowed from them, that they are now thought the firſt Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors: yet there are yet ſome Oyls and Unguents from them deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated, as this now deſcribed, which was at firſt divulged by an Aegyptian. For it is probable, that it rather derived its name from this cauſe, then from its dusky colour, like that of the Aegyptians. Many call it the Melleous Unguent, from its Baſis, which is Honey; but uſe muſt ſometimes be preferred before reaſon: We, with My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropoliſts, call it the Aegyptian Unguent. It is thus made: The Honey muſt be cocted with Vinegar, and pulverated Verdigreaſe, in an earthen veſſel, on a ſlow fire, till the Vinegar be diſſipated, the tincture of the Verdigreaſe changed, and all brought to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence of an Unguent. <hi>Meſue</hi> calls it the great Unguent, that is, the eximious; not in difference of any leſſer.</p>
                              <p>It is of moſt uſe for inveterate and fiſtulous Ulcers; for it deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges them, arceates putretude, abſumes corruption, eats up excreſcent and dead fleſh, but not without ſenſe of dolour: if maſculine Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kincenſe be added to it, whereunto <hi>Meſue</hi> ſeems to aſſent, it will be ſomewhat milder, and not ſo ſarcotical.</p>

Now Antalium and Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talium being Conchiles, Sea-welks, and Cockles, may be ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted in their ſtead.</p>
                              <p>By Gerſa, we underſtand a certain Ceruſe or Foecula, made of the root of the herb Dragon; or in defect thereof, of the root of Jairy, and Roſe-water; which is thus prepared: The roots of the greater herb Dragon muſt be collected in the Spring, waſhed, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and dryed; then pulverated very ſmall in a Stone-Morter, and put in an earthen or glaſs veſſel with Roſe-water; then covered with a linen cloth, and dryed in the Sun; afterwards brayed, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defied with Roſe-water, and dryed by inſolation, which muſt be iterated three or four dayes; then the powder madefied with odo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate wine, coacted into Paſtils, dryed in a ſhade, repoſed for uſe, and uſurped for Garſa.</p>
                              <p>The Unguents preparation is after this manner: The greaſes muſt all be melted together in an earthen pot, wherein two Citrons or Oranges cut into pieces, muſt be macerated a whole night; the next morning cocted and percolated; the Marble, Chryſtal, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, Navels, Antals, and Dentals, muſt be pulverated very ſmall, as alſo the reſt, but all of them apart, eſpecially Camphyr, Amylum, Frankincenſe, Amiantum, and Boras: but Gerſa being friable, may be levigated, by light motion, on an inverted ſieve. When all are duly levigated, they muſt be mixed and agitated together with the melted, ſtrained, and hot fats, that they may concrete to an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guent. But the quantity of Fats ſeems too little for the Powders, which therefore muſt either be augmented, or they leſſened: for Apothecaries require for one pound of Powders, ſeven or eight of Fat; but the Powders may be ſaved, and when uſe calls for them, mixed with a ſufficient quantity of Fats.</p>

                              <p>Many are infeſted with the tumour of their Spleen; others with its induration, without any great tumour; and others with both: all of them have gravity and gripings in their Hypochondria, tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours in their left ſides, difficulty of breathing, and prave and plumbeous colours, black and turgid veins towards their Spleens, inflation of feet; and lying on the left ſide is grievous to them.</p>
                              <p>This Unguent adhibited to the regions of their Spleens, after ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Praeſidies will much profit; for it is malactical, or mollitive, reſolvative, apertive, roborative, and ſplenetical; whence it hath that name. It ſhould not therefore be omitted; but ſeeing its uſe is ſalubrious, ſhould be kept in Pharmacopolies.</p>
                              <p>For its preparation, let the Oyls and Butter boyl on a ſlow fire with the ſucces, till the ſucces be diſſipated; then mix diſſolved Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniack with them, then the Powders, afterwards the Wax, and make an Unguent: whereunto, adde ſome Oyl of Spike, which by its tenuity will cauſe better permeation for the reſt, and emend the Unguents odour.</p>

                              <p>The COMMENTARY.</p>
                              <p>I wiſh, that Medicks would ſpeak of the venereous diſeaſe and its cure, without injury to any Nation: For many, ignorant of its ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal, cauſe and nature, referre it to ſuch, from whom they recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it, whether juſtly or injuſtly. Hence ſome call it the Spaniſh, others the Italian, and others the French diſeaſe. But the French, being men that will not put up an injury, hearing the diſeaſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed on them, which they had rightly called the Indian, or Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reous Pox; they called both the diſeaſe and its remedy, Italian, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Italians had wronged them firſt; and ſometimes the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an: for the Spaniards brought it firſt out of <hi>India</hi> into <hi>Italy;</hi> whence the French, taking <hi>Neapolis,</hi> brought home this Neapolitan fruit. But to my purpoſe. This Indian Unguent may ſerve in ſtead of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry many of that name, which are unduly confected of Swines-fat, and Quickſilver, and ſometimes a few ſimples unduly united, and kept in many Pharmacopolies; whereby the diſeaſed, in ſtead of
<pb n="710" facs="tcp:37350:412"/>help, gets the Palſey, Stupour, and Trembling: But this we have deſcribed, conſiſts of many things that hinder ſuch affections, that roborate the Nerves, extinguiſh the malign and peccant quality of the humours, and reſolve the humours, propelling many by ſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Some adde Petreol and Euphorbium, which being exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hot and tenuious, may help cold natures; but they much harm the bilious and temperate. Some alſo adde Mithridate and the Theriack; but we omit them, as not alexiterial to this diſeaſe: but Quickſilver is very efficacious, if duly prepared, as we have elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where demonſtrated.</p>
                              <p>For the preparation of this Unguent, the wax muſt firſt be melted on a moderate fire with the Oyls; then Aqua-vitae added to them, which muſt be agitated and calefied till the water be exhaled; then incorporate them with Quickſilver, Fat, and Turpentine; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto adde the Powders, and ſubact all into an Unguent.</p>
                              <p>That the Quickſilver may be duly prepared, it ſhould firſt be trajected through a woollen cloth, that its plumbago may be ſegre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated; then extinguiſhed with jejune and ſound ſpittle: for being thus tamed, it is fitter for this confection, then when extinct in the ſucce of Henbane and Lemmons, though the Greaſe and Turpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine take away much of its ferity. Its malign quality may be very well caſtigated in the Oyl of Turpentine duly prepared.</p>
                              <p>It cures the flux of the mouth, or the exputation of virulent hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours through the mouth, if after purgation, the parts be twice or thrice anointed therewith.</p>
                              <p>We have neglected many Unguents deſcribed in vulgar Antido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries, becauſe their uſe is either not approved of, or diſallowed of, or their faculties reſpondent to, and contained in theſe we have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed. For he that hath the Styptical Unguent, or Aregon of <hi>Fernelius,</hi> needs not the Unguent of Comitiſſa and Arthanita.</p>

                              <p>You may thus make it: Divide the wax into pieces, melt it in the Oyl of Roſes not perfectly explicated; take it from the fire, and transfuſe it into another veſſel; and when it is cold, and moderately concreted, affund cold water upon it, and agitate it; which iterate, till the mixture will take no more: whereunto, if you adde a little thin white-wine Vinegar, it will be more humectative and refrige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative. <hi>Galen</hi> adviſes, when it ſhould be made very refrigerative, to put the ſucces of Lettice, Nightſhade, Sempervive, and ſuch refri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerants to it.

                                 <hi>Meſue</hi> deſcribes three Cerata's, whereof we ſelect this one, attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to <hi>Galen,</hi> as moſt efficacious and uſual: which yet <hi>Rondeletius,</hi> by the addition of Ammoniack and Storax, hath made more effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual: for thus confected, it performs thoſe effects which the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions of <hi>Pilagrius</hi> and <hi>Paulus</hi> pollicitate. Wherefore he that hath this, may be without the others. It is called <hi>Oeſypatum,</hi> from its Baſis Oeſypum; which you may thus extract: Take a fit quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of wooll evelled from the necks, bellies and privities of ſheep; macerate it eight hours in hot water, agitate it all the while with a ſtick; then ſervefie it on the fire, till it depoſe its fatneſs into the water: extract, and violently expreſs the wooll; and then transfuſe the water from one veſſel to another with much force, that it may eructate much ſpume; which collect, and repoſe in a veſſel apart: iterate the transfuſion in the hot Sun, till all the fat ſpume be col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected; which waſh, and agitate in pure water, till its filth be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregated, and the laſt water remain limpid, and the fatneſs leave no acrimony on the tongue; then put it in a denſe earthen pot, and keep it in a cold place. It is emollitive, reſolvative, calefactive and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynous.</p>
                              <p>The Ceratum you may thus confect: firſt pulverate the Saffron, Maſtick, Spikenard and Storax apart; then mix their powders toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; macerate Ammoniack in Vinegar, melt it, and coct it to the conſiſtence of Honey; then liquefie the wax in Oyl; take them from the fire, and put therein Oeſypum, diſſolved Ammoniack, and Turpentine together, then agitate and ſubact all the powders toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that they may acquire due ſpiſſitude.</p>

                              <hi>BOth the Matter and Vertue of Unguents and Salves are one, their conſiſtence different; which in the one is ſoft and liquid, in the other craſs and ſolid: which are therefore made into Rolls and Bacils of a fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers length and craſsitude, and ſometimes much more; and not repoſed in veſſels like Unguents, but involved in papers, and ſo kept in Pharmaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polies. That they may acquire that craſsitude, they admit of more Wax, and leſs Oyl then Unguents; as twice, thrice, and ſometimes four times as much Wax as Oyl: which quantity of Wax muſt be augmented or leſſened, according to the quantity of Roſines and concrete ſucces; as alſo the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Oyl, as the doſis of Fats, Greaſe and Marrow may ingrede the confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. Now Salves are confected of the parts of Plants and Animals, of Minerals and Metals; ſome whereof give onely the body and conſistence, without any great vertue, as Wax, common Oyl, Quickſilver, and ſome Roſines; others with matter, give alſo vertue and efficacy, as Minerals, Plants, and the other Ingredients. All Salves do not admit of Wax and Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſines, but receive Ladanum, Frankincenſe, and other things for their mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: Some alſo are made without Wax and fire, whoſe materials are Honey, viſcid Succes, Cream, and the like, concreted to a due ſpiſsitude; as the Salve of Bread-Cruſts and Bayberries, and the like. This order muſt be obſerved in confecting Salves: firſt the Wax muſt be melted in Oyl; then the liquors, ſucces, and Mucagines mixed therewith, and cocted on a ſlow fire, till the aqueous humidity be exhaled; then muſt the Fats and Roſines be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; as alſo all kindes of Gummes: Some whereof are mixed ſincere,
<pb n="715" facs="tcp:37350:414"/>others diluted, colated, and cocted in Wine, Vinegar, or other liquor: if Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine be required, it may be added when the Salve is percocted, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted from the fire; then muſt the hard Powders be caſt and ſprinkled, agitated, ſubacted, and concreted into a maſs neither ſoft nor hard, but mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate and viſcid, which will not inquinate the contractants hands. If liquid ſucces, as Wine, Vinegar, Medicinal Waters or Decoctions, ingrede a Salves confection, they muſt be cocted till their aqueous humidity be diſsipated. New and ſpiſs Succes muſt be diſſolved in ſome liquor, which muſt alſo be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipated by coction; dry and friable ones muſt be pulverated and mixed therewith. And as it is of great moment, which muſt be firſt put in the diſpenſation, and which laſt: ſo alſo, which muſt be longer, which leſs coct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. For the light coction of Lithargie makes the Medicament white; the longer, black. Verdigreaſe makes it ſometimes citreous, ſometimes green, and ſometimes fusk, according to the various heat of the fire: And the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of colour, often argues the mutation of qualities; for Lithargie, by longer coction, makes the Salve both blacker and more exſiccative. And though the conſiſtence and faculties be the moſt looked after in Salves; yet their colour and odour make them more commendable. But ſeeing we have abundantly treated of general Precepts in confecting Salves, in our Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> (Chap. 4. Book 3.) <hi>it now onely reſts, that we diſcuſs the particular preparation and confection of each of them.</hi>

                           <p>The COMMENTARY.</p>
                           <p>The denomination of this Salve is multifarious: for from the mucagineous ſucces, which it admits in great plenty, it is called <hi>Diachylon;</hi> from its colour, <hi>Album;</hi> from its uſual frequency, <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mune;</hi> and from the five Simples that ingrede its Confection, <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tapharmacum;</hi> and often, <hi>Simple Diachylon,</hi> in reference to another more compoſititious. The whole Family of Myropoliſts acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge <hi>Meſue</hi> its Author, though <hi>Serapio</hi> and <hi>Avicenna</hi> gave deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions thereof before him: and all exhibit it according to the ſuperiour form, wherein Oyl and Lithargie ſuppeditate matter and corpulency, and Succes efficacy; which mixed in divers proportions, and after divers preparations, make up this Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſter. For more dilucidation, prepare it thus: Purge the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thargie from its Lead, droſs, and filth; then levigate it ſmall, agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, and ſubact it twelve hours in a Metalline-Morter with Oyl; then coct it on a ſlow fire, alwayes ſtirring it, till the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thargie incraſſate to a melleous conſiſtence, and adheres not to the
<pb n="716" facs="tcp:37350:415"/>bottom of the Kettle; then take it off the fire, that it may cool; then fervefie the ſucces extracted in water aparr, till their more aqueous parts be exhaled; then mix about a third part thereof ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curately with the Lithargie, and coct them again, till the Lithar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie incraſſate as before; then put the reſt to it, and agitate them, letting them fervefie on a ſlow fire, till they be all united, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated into a Salve of a legitimate conſiſtence; and if you put an ounce of the powder of Orris, to each pound of this Salve, then you have <hi>Diachylon Ireatum.</hi> It is a ſign the Salve is perfectly cocted, when a part thereof adheres not to a Marble, nor inquinates the contrectants hands: yet it ſhould be ſequacious and viſcid, that Rolls may be formed thereof, involved in paper, and kept.</p>
                           <p>It is the beſt Mollitive: for it mollifies the hard tumours, and cocts the humours of the Liver, Spleen, Ventricle, and other parts: that which admits of Orris, attracts, incides, and reſolves more.</p>

                           <p>As the Simple and Ireatum were, ſo the great and Gummatum Diachylon are conjoyned, and deſcribed all in one order, becauſe in name and faculties they have much affinity. <hi>Paul.

<pb n="717" facs="tcp:37350:415"/>more convenient for this Emplaiſter: The Wax and Roſine muſt be put into theſe, whilſt they are on the fire; the Turpentine and Oeſypus may be added, when they are abſtracted from the fire: all the maſs muſt be continually agitated, that its conſiſtence may be idoneous. Some, by induſtrious ſedulity, mix a ſmall quantity of the Mucagines, at firſt, with the Oyls and Lithargie, that they may hinder its ſubſidence to the bottom of the veſſel, and make the Salve whiter.</p>
                           <p>Its faculties effect the ſame with the former, but more efficaciouſly: for it mollifies, cocts, and digeſts better: The Gummatum Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chylon attracts, mollifies, and reſolves potently.</p>

                           <p>Seeing there are many capital Diſeaſes, which beſides the help of Chirurgeons, require Topical Medicaments; and few of them onely can be helped by the Emplaiſter <hi>de Janua: Andernacus</hi> did well, to deſcribe this of Betony, which is more efficacious, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly curing more preternatural affections of the head. You may thus prepare it: Contund the herbs well in a Morter, mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate them a whole week in white-wine, agitate and coct them, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs and ſtrain the wine, and coct it, till the third part be abſumed; then put Oyl of Firre to it, then melted wax, afterwards Gummes and Roſines, and laſt of all Turpentine: when theſe are pretty cold, adde to them the reſt that are pulverated or concreted, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes agitating them till the whole humour be exorbed; laſt of all put Goats-milk or Cows-milk to them, and make Rolls.</p>
                           <p>It unites fractures,

                           <p>Medicks do daily preſcribe Medicaments for preſent uſe, better then the vulgar Diſpenſatories ſuppeditate; which Pharmacopoliſts have deſcribed and kept, after they have noted their effects; and thus women keep ſome Receipts in their Cloſets, from which they once found eaſe: And thus a Bythinian Barber had a Salve from ſome of his coaetaneous Medicks, which being often ſucceſsfully uſed, is ſince always called, The Barbers Salve. Thus alſo a Weaver of <hi>Paris</hi> got a black Unguent, like the vulgar Baſilicon, which he exhibited to all Sores; and when he was dead, his Son made, and gave the like: Inſomuch, that one could ſcarce live half a week in <hi>Paris,</hi> but he would ſee and try the Weavers Unguent.</p>
                           <p>And although Medicks often diſapprove of ſuch as the ignorant approve of; yet <hi>Aetius</hi> much commends this Barbers Salve, for the cure of the Spleen, Dropſie, and Sciatica: for, ſaith he, it hath freed many from the dolour of the Hips; for it attracts, digeſts, and reſolves watry humours; which it effects more facilely, if it be confected with Oyl of Orris, or ſome Fat: nay, it can ſcarce be made without Fats; therefore I think half a pound of Oyl ſhould be adjected.</p>
                           <p>If Chamaeleons-root cannot be had, an equal weight of the root of vulgar Bryony, commonly called White-vine, may be added in its ſtead; eſpecially when it is required for the cure of the Spleen and Dropſie. But the root of the other Bryony, which they call The bleſſed Virgins Seal, is a more convenient ſubſtitute for the cure of the Sciatica, or any arthritical dolour.</p>
                           <p>Which wilde Bryony is a kinde of ſoft Ivy, ſo delighting in arundincous and watry places, that it alwayes ſeeks water-banks; inſomuch, that where-ever Botanicks finde this Plant, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude there is water underneath.</p>

                           <p>Myropoliſts and Chirurgeons do rather from Cuſtom then Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon retain this Name of <hi>Diapalma,</hi> which was given to this Salve, becauſe it is in cocting, agitated, moved, and ſubacted with a rudicle of Palm-wood: ſome, mutuating its name from its Baſis, call it more rightly, The Emplaiſter of Diachalcitis; but ſuch as put a difference betwixt Vitriol and Chalcitis, ſay, that this is made of Chalcitis, Diapalma of Vitriol, and in all things the they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like. However, many make them not alike: for in the confection of this of Diachalcitis, they put onely three ounces of burnt Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citis, injecting into its coction, by <hi>Galen</hi>'s advice, ſome branches of the Palm minutely incided: but they make the palmeous Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſter after the form preſcribed, agitating it alwayes with a pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meous ſpatle; and firſt of all they coct the Lithargie minutely pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verated on a ſlow fire, with Oyl and Fat, alwayes agitating it with a rudicle of the Palm, or ſome other aſtrictive Tree, as the Oak or Medlar, newly cut from the Tree. And that the Salve may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate more of its Medicamental faculty, they preſcind its extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, and abrade it to the very radical moiſture. When the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is cocted and incraſſated, they ſubſtract it from the fire, and put Roman or white Vitriol in it; and in defect of the true Chalcitis, inject the pulverated one, and ſubact it: and ſo they have a maſs of a juſt conſiſtence, whereof they make Rolls. Many would have the Vitriol cocted with the other Ingredients, that it might depoſe part of its acrimony: in which there is reaſon.</p>

                           <p>This Salve is one of them which is indued with a ſpecious name for oſtentations ſake; as that <hi>Iſotheos Antidotus</hi> in <hi>Aetius,</hi> that <hi>Empla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrum Iſis</hi> in <hi>Paulus,</hi> and that other which <hi>Aetius</hi> mentions, that is called <hi>Man,</hi> conſiſting onely of Sandyx and Oyl: for by ſuch a name not onely Ruſticks, but thoſe of the Citizens, that think themſelves wiſer, are incited to buy ſuch a Medicament. We will therefore, with the troop of Aromatories, call this Medicament <hi>Emplaſtrum de gratia Dei,</hi> and confect it thus: VVe take green herbs newly ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, cut them ſmall, bray them well in a ſtone-Morter, macerate them a whole day in a ſufficient quantity of generous wine; then coct them, till half the wine be abſumed; then we expreſs the herbs, and abject them, breaking or cutting the wax into the perco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated liquor, there to be melted and cocted, continually agitating it till the liquor be abſumed; then we bray, commix, and melt therein the Roſines; and taking it off the fire, unite the Turpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine therewith: when it is almoſt cold, we adject the Maſtick, and ſo we acquire a Salve of a legitimate conſiſtence.</p>
                           <p>It purges and cloſes wounds and Ulcers,
<note place="margin">Vires.</note> roborates the parts to which it is adhibited: all which it would do more efficaciouſly, if it were made with red wine.</p>

                           <p>Whilſt I reade or hear theſe ſpecious Names, I cannot but think of the eximious Remedies of the Alchymiſts, who ſeeing their Elixir-vitae grow thread-bare, called it The Angelical Potion: but the name is tolerable, where the faculties are reſponſible; as in this Emplaiſter, which being very efficacious, though not Divine, we ſhall by authority call Divine.</p>
                           <p>You may thus confect it: Agitate, move, and ſtir well-pulvera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Lithargie for twelve hours ſpace with Oyl; and alwayes mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it, coct it to the craſſitude of Honey; then cut the wax in pieces, mix it with the Oyl, and melt it: in the mean time, macerate, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve, and ſtrain the Gummes in Vinegar, or tenuious white-wine, and coct them till the aqueous humidity be diſcuſſed and evaporated;
<pb n="724" facs="tcp:37350:418"/>then mix Turpentine therewith, and inject and incorporate them all with the Lithargie, united with Oyl and Wax: to all theſe, adde the Powders of Myrrhe, Maſtick, Frankincenſe, Ariſtolochy, and the Magnet brayed apart; then mix Verdigreaſe brayed, but not cocted too long, leſt it make the Salve red: Theſe well united, and commixed, will be a Salve of a due ſpiſſitude. Some, in ſtead of the Powder of Amyentis, take the Powder of ſweet Amentum, that is, the fat of Glaſs: but it is better confected with the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnet.</p>
                           <p>It mollifies the parts whereunto it is adhibited; it allayes do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, attracts, digeſts, and reſolves humours.</p>

                           <p>The Author indeed of this Emplaiſter is uncertain; but the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, doſis of its ſimples, and the manner of its preparation, are farre more uncertain: for ſome confect it in form of an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guent, as <hi>Praepoſitus;</hi> others in form of an Emplaiſter: to whoſe compoſition, ſome aſſume Lithargie, Amylum, and the Whites of Egges, as <hi>Paulus</hi> and <hi>Myrepſus;</hi> others make it of Wax, Ceruſe, and Oyl: Some again aſſume twice as much Oyl as Ceruſe; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, a like quantity of both: Some take more Wax, others more Oyl. The deſcription we give is moſt uſual, the confection we teach is moſt eaſie, and the compoſition we approve of moſt effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious; wherein we rather aſſume two pounds of Oyl of Roſes and Omphacinum, then of common Oyl, a pound and an half of Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſe, and onely four ounces of Wax. Now before Ceruſe ingrede the confection, it ſhould be often waſhed in common or Roſe-water, then agitated in a Marble-Morter with a ligneous Peſtel; then it ſhould reſide; and when it is ſetled, the water be effuſed, and more again affunded, with which it muſt be agitated; which muſt be iterated, till the water appear pure and limpid; which then may be ejected, and Trochisks formed out of the remaining white Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſe, which muſt be dryed in the Sun, and repoſed for uſe: whereof the deſcribed quantity muſt be taken, and levigated very ſmall, for the confection of this Salve: But after levigation, it muſt be firſt cocted in the radiant Sun over a ſlow fire, and agitated continually with a ſpatle; then muſt the wax be melted, and ſtirred with it, that all may acquire a due ſpiſſitude.</p>
                           <p>It is of much uſe, not onely in drying cutaneous vices, and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficial Exulcerations, but alſo in coagulating greater Ulcers,

                           <p>This Emplaſtick is alſo Stomachical, but not ſo hot as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer: for ſeeing all imbecility of ſtomach ariſes not from cold cauſes; as ſubſerſion, which frequently happens without a cold
<pb n="726" facs="tcp:37350:419"/>diſtemper; and proneneſs to vomit, which follows upon any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper, without vicious humours, it is not equal that its roborative Medicament ſhould be alwayes hot; but Reaſon commands, that it ſhould be varied and changed, according to the variety of the pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant cauſe: for it is impoſſible to finde out a Medicament that is beſt for all affections, but it will more efficaciouſly help one, and another more imbecilely; and it often falls out, that a hot Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſter may profit the ſtomach, and offend the hot Liver. Hence the Proverb:
<q>Stomachicum juvat, &amp; occidit Hepaticum.</q> This Emplaiſter then may ſafely be adhibited to the hotter imbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile Ventricle: For whoſe preparation, all muſt be pulverated and brayed apart; then the wax muſt be melted with the Oyl, and the Turpentine added when it is ſubſtracted from the fire; then muſt Bole, Ivory, Roſes and Coral, after juſt levigation, be commixed therewith; then muſt all be accurately ſubacted with the Maſtick into a juſt craſſitude.</p>

                           <p>The Matrix or Uterus doth not onely abound with Diſeaſes, but is the very Spring and Continent of moſt Muliebral Affections: for when that ſuffers, the whole Body is ill-affected; when that is recreated, the whole Body recruits. And hence Medicks have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed many Medicaments for its ſolace, as Priapiſcota, Fomenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, little Baths, Liniments, Unguents, and Salves, wherein ſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veolent and aromatical Ingredients are admitted; with whoſe fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grancy, whether interiouſly immitted, or exteriouſly adhibited, it is much delighted, though not under ſpecies of odour, as we have noted in our Inſtitutions. Its moſt uſual Topical Medicament is this Emplaiſter, thence denominated: for whoſe confection, you
<pb n="727" facs="tcp:37350:419"/>muſt take wax and Ladanum cut into pieces, and melt and agitate them with Oyl: when they are thus melted, remove them from the fire; and while they are hot, put Turpentine and Storax to them: when theſe are thus untied and refrigerated, mix the reſt of the powders with them, alwayes agitating and ſubacting them, till they acquire due ſpiſſitude. <hi>Praepoſitus</hi> addes neither Fat nor Oyl: but it cannot be well made without the one of theſe; we have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore adjoyned Moſchatelline Oyl, as moſt convenient for the ſcope and part. VVe may hence gather, how inept a VVriter <hi>Praepoſitus</hi> was, who ſpeaks ſo barbarouſly; and how imperite a Pharmaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poean, who knows not the legitimate Compoſition, nor the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of due preparation, nor the idoneous conſiſtence of Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. I admire that this later Age will tolerate the Name of ſo fooliſh an Author, and precipitantly evolve his leaves, and not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punge each line for folly. But this by the way: I will not carp at the dead; Though ſuch dead men bite thoſe that receive their pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillous Medicaments. But to my purpoſe. Some think, that the Oyl of Jeat, or ſome ſuch foetid ſtuff, ſhould be adjected hereto, that it may better agree to the ſtrangulation of the Uterus: but ſuch ratiocination ſmells of no skill; for no impoſition of foetid Medicaments to the region of the Uterus, can hinder its ſuffocation. But ſuch muſt be adhibited to the Noſtrils, if they be taken for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit. And though we ſhould grant, that ſome graveolents might profit the Uterus, yet they ſhould not ſurely be mixed with Musk, Citrian Santal, and ſuch aromatical Materials. Here note, That by <hi>Antera,</hi> we underſtand the inferiour part of Roſes, accompanied with capillaments and grains; not <hi>Anthera,</hi> that is, florid, which was an ancient Medicament deſcribed for the vices of the mouth, but now obſolete.</p>

                           <p>The COMMENTARY.</p>
                           <p>It is eaſie to know thoſe Medicaments which <hi>Praepoſitus</hi> tranſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, from thoſe he deſcribed and invented: for thoſe he invented
<pb n="728" facs="tcp:37350:420"/>are either defective or exceſſive; or peccant in the doſis of the Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, or in the manner of their preparation; or elſe ineptly deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, as this very Emplaiſter, which, if made after the Authors minde, would in conſiſtence reſemble a hard Paſte, no Salve; for it would be preſently dry, hard, and pulverable: therefore I thought good to adde ſome Oyls, with other Simples accommodated to the ſcope, and convenient for the colligation of the Powders.</p>
                           <p>That you may duly confect it, cut the skin of a young Ram new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly detracted, into pieces, and coct it, and the wooll on it, twelve hours, or a whole day, if need be, that it may diſſolve; then expreſs the decoction, and abject the wooll; in one pound of the colature, coct the berries of the Miſsletoe of the Oak, or of ſome other tree, of like quantity, till their aqueous humidity be abſumed; then ſtrain them: in the mean while, waſh Earth-worms in wine, coct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, till they be diſſolved, and then ſtrain them; mix Oyl with the colature, and ſet it again on the fire, till its watry humour be diſcuſſed; then mix the two colatures together, and therein melt the Wax, Colophony, and Pitch, exactly agitating them, that they burn not; mix Galbanum and Ammoniack, which muſt firſt be diſſolved, ſtrained, and cocted to a melleous ſpiſſitude, with the liquor almoſt conſumed by cocture: ſubſtract all from the fire, and put Turpentine to them; and then adde the powders artifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally levigated: and all theſe duly prepared, mixed, united and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted, will be an Emplaiſter of a legitimate conſiſtence.</p>
                           <p>In defect of the berries of the Miſsletoe of the Oak, <hi>Joubertus</hi> ſubſtitutes a Succedanium, adding many more aſtrictives, that the Salve may be more agglutinative. <hi>Arnaldus</hi> fooliſhly poſtulates the blood of a red Man; as though the blood of another ſound and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guineous Man were not better: but Swines blood is all out as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient. <hi>Praepoſitus</hi> requires red wax, that is, new wax, which is ſo flave, that it ſeems ſubrubeous; but white wax is more accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date. He would alſo have the Marble whereon the maſs is injected, madefied with Oyl of Violets: we chuſe the Oyl of Maſtick for that purpoſe.</p>
                           <p>It moſt efficaciouſly conſtringes and roborates lax parts, cohibits fluxions: it coarctates the dilatation of the Peritonaeum, through which the Inteſtines delabe: whence it cures burſting, and is by ſome Pharmacopoliſts called the Emplaiſter for burſting; and by others, The Emplaiſter of the Rams-skin.</p>

                           <p>The COMMENTARY.</p>
                           <p>As the parts of the Body are diſſimilar in form, temper, and actions: ſo muſt their Medicaments, whereby each part is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved or cured, be diſſimilar; for the Eyes call for one, the Lungs another, the Uterus another, and the Bones another: yea, the ſame part oft requires divers Medicaments, according to the diverſity of the affection wherewith it is peſtered. For thoſe Medicaments that conduce to the rottenneſs and wormeatenneſs of the Bones, are not uſed in their Fractures: for the curing whereof, moſt Chirurgeons perperouſly adhibit onely aſtrictives; ſome exhibiting onely <hi>Oxy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croceum;</hi> others, <hi>Emplaſtrum de pelle Arietina,</hi> or <hi>Contra Rupturam;</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, <hi>The vulgar Ceroneum:</hi> whence, perhaps, the Nomenclature of that Emplaiſter is decocted, which is ſo much celebrated at <hi>Paris,</hi> which they give indiſcriminately to all that crave help, and adhibit promiſcuouſly to all diſeaſes and parts. And hence many, by the occluſion of their paſſages, and retention of their excrementitious humours, are loaden with dolours, infeſted with the Itch, or beſet with Ulcers.</p>
                           <p>Apothecaries therefore ſhould have peculiar skull-Plaiſters, which may not be onely aſtrictive and roborative, but withall conſervative, accelerating generation and increaſe; as this we now exhibit, whoſe preparation we ſhall a little open for Apprentices ſakes: Firſt then the roots muſt be cleanſed, and cut into pieces; the herbs cut ſmall, and cocted in an equal portion of black wine, and ſteel-water, till half thereof be diſſipated; the ſucces muſt be injected into the ſtrained liquor, and boyled there, till the aqueous humidity be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haled; then muſt the Oyls be commixed, afterwards the Wax, and then the Lithargie: when they are taken off the fire, percolated, and united by agitation, the Turpentine muſt be added, and then the Powders; and all muſt be well mixed, agitated, and ſubacted, that they may make up an Emplaiſter of a due conſiſtence.</p>
                           <p>If Tutſan cannot be had, the ſeed or ſummities of S. Johns-wort may be ſubſtituted in its ſtead. By Virgins-wax, we mean that which is flave, citrian, and newly ſegregated from the Honey, which is more apt and uſeful in roborating the Nerves.</p>
                           <p>This Salve hath an excellent faculty in curing the fractures of Bones: for it helps and accelerates their coalition, when they are coagulated, increaſes their brawnineſs, foments the innate calour of the part, and ſtayes the fluxions of humours.</p>
                           <pb n="730" facs="tcp:37350:421"/>
                           <p>I could wiſh all Chirurgeons to make this Emplaiſter, and not to ſuffer ſome ignorant fellows ſo freely; who with one <hi>Ceroneum</hi> (as they call it) unduly prepared (it is probable) promiſe the cure of all Sores.</p>

                           <p>The COMMENTARY.</p>
                           <p>As <hi>India,</hi> by the inſtitution of Nature, firſt produced both the Venereous Pox and its Remedy: ſo <hi>Italy,</hi> which firſt infected <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi> with this Diſeaſe, refects the ſame with the beſt Medicament: for <hi>Joannes de Vigo,</hi> an Italian, conſulting his own (it may be) and Countreys good, compoſed this Emplaiſter, of eximious vertue, for the cure of the Italian, which they ineptly call the French diſeaſe: whoſe deſcription is good, though the manner of preparation which he preſcribes, be ill enough; for he would have all confuſedly cocted together, till he come at Lithargie. But Neotericks do thus better inſtruct.</p>
                           <p>Firſt waſh the Earth-worms in wine, and coct them and living great Water-frogs together, in the Fats of a Swine and a Calf, and wine, till the third part of the wine be abſumed; then adde Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwort, Stoechados, and Schoenantum; and then boyl them again, till the wine be exhaled; and then adde the ſucces and Oyls, and a little after, the Fat of a Viper, or, for want thereof, of a Snake; then coct them, till the aqueous humour be abſumed; and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards expreſs them ſtrongly: in the Colature, coct the Lithargie duly levigated, agitating and ſtirring it into the form of an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guent; then adde the wax, and melt it; then take it off the fire, and conject brayed Frankincenſe and Euphorbium into it; after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Turpentine and Storax: when you have duly mixed, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitated, united, and refrigerated theſe, traject the Quickſilver through a denſe cloth, after its extinction by jejune ſpittle, and mix it with the reſt: which ſubact and reduce into the idoneous form of an Emplaiſter, whereof form Rolls for uſe.</p>
                           <pb n="731" facs="tcp:37350:421"/>
                           <p>This is the beſt form for the compoſition of this Emplaiſter, which the moſt Apothecaries follow; ſome whereof duplicate, others tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate the quantity of Quickſilver, that the Medicament may be more efficacious in expugning the Indian Pox. Some like not its extinction by jejune ſpittle, but had rather have it done with a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Turpentine, or Hogs-greaſe; and it may indeed be very well extinguiſhed by any of theſe wayes: but I had rather have it done with Sage; for the Quickſilver ſo caſtigated will not hurt the Nerves.</p>
                           <p>Some deſire to know what Oyl they muſt take, of the many va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieties of them of Spike: I anſwer, That <hi>Vigo</hi> means that Oyl which is educed by diſtillation from the greater latifolious Lavan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dula, and not the other that is educed by infuſion out of the Indian Spike, which the ſame Author, and <hi>Meſue,</hi> alwayes call Oyl of Spikenard, calling the other Oyl of Spike ſimply.</p>
                           <p>Neither do all conſent about Frogs: for ſome ſay Water-frogs, others Wood-frogs, and others Paluſtrian-frogs: I alwayes prefer the Water-frogs before the other, which are often venenate; but any, in defect thereof, may well enough ſupply the place: and any one may at liberty chuſe theſe or the other, ſeeing they all agree equally almoſt to this external Medicament.</p>
                           <p>The faculties of this Medicament, which ſome make in form of a Ceratum or an Unguent, are well known, not onely to Medicks and Chirurgeons, but all ſuch as have been harmed by Venery.</p>

                           <p>The COMMENTARY.</p>
                           <p>To the number of Emplaiſters, they referre a certain cloth Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaſtical on both ſides, which Neotericks call <hi>Sparadrappa;</hi> whereof there are as many ſorts, as a Cloth may be infected with Salves: for ſome are vulnerary, others catagmatical; the one uſed in aggluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating wounds, the other bones: but no diſeaſes call for Spara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draps ſo frequently, as inveterate Ulcers, and holes left by Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roticks; whereunto this we have deſcribed is moſt uſeful. For whoſe confection, firſt melt the fat and wax with Oyl, mix the brayed Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thargie with the liquament; wherein, agitate, ſtir, and coct it: afterwards, adde the other Powders, alwayes ſtirring, mixing, and uniting them into a legitimate Emplaiſter; wherein, a cloth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what worn muſt be demerged, and incalcated while it is hot, till it
<pb n="732" facs="tcp:37350:422"/>be all over infected, inquinated, and incruſtated: which then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, expoſe to the air that it may dry, and repoſe for uſe.</p>
                           <p>This Cloth is partly Sarcotical, partly Collective and Epulo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical; that is, it generates fleſh, agglutinates, ſiccates, and heals wounds and Ulcers: it ſtayes fluxions, and roborates the parts whereunto it is adhibited.</p>
                           <p>He that would have more deſcriptions of Sparadrappes, may reade the laſt Chapter of the ſecond Section of our fifth Book of Inſtitutions.</p>
                           <p>There may as many Sparadrappes be made by Art, as Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſters.</p>
                           <p>We have omitted ſome few Salves; as ſuch as we could either not approve of, or diſallow of; or elſe ſuch as were more then ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed in thoſe we have deſcribed. For the uſe of the Salves of <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bary</hi> and <hi>Diaphoenician,</hi> is quite decayed; the Apoſtolical Salve is ſeldome made; and he that hath the <hi>Divinum,</hi> may well be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it; as he that hath <hi>Oxycroecum,</hi> without <hi>Ceroneum.</hi> We have given the beſt and moſt uſeful, not onely of Salves, but alſo of other Medicaments, for internal aſſumption, and external adhibition: All which, if an Apothecary will make, and keep in his Shop, he ſhall not want any thing for the expugnation of Diſeaſes.</p>

                  <p>I Cannot think that pulchritude or deformity of Body, conduce any thing to the probity or improbity of manners: for many more deformed then <hi>Therſites,</hi> have been famous; and many more beautiful then <hi>Adonis,</hi> infamous. I have alſo known many deform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed women, impious to purpoſe: But I purpoſe not to exhibit Paints to theſe, nor Comptory Waters to toothleſs old Hags, to erugate or emend their Faces; herein following the prudence of <hi>Galen,</hi> though a Pagan, who diſallows of not onely the Painting of Faces, but the Tinctures of Hair; profeſſing, that he never exhibited any thing of that nature, to ſuch as took more delight in Ornaments then Health.</p>
                  <p>Our Antidotary then ſhall want theſe nefarious Medicaments, wherewith Harlots incite and deceive Youngſters: for this Fucato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Art, we ſee, is exerciſed by none but ſome Juglers, and vafrous Knaves, who ſeeking ſecretly to pick a Whores Purſe, promiſe her Oyl of Talkum, which they never ſaw, wherewith ſhe may not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly erugate her Face, but reſtore her ſelf to Youth again; and then exhibit two Unguents, the one Red, and the other White, both Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh, and participating of a malign quality.

And hence it is, that women who uſe theſe Sublimata's, have black Teeth wormeaten, corrugated Faces, and praevious old Age. The Colour therefore which Nature's Pencil draws is beſt: whoſe Works, whileſt we admire, let us give Eternal Glory and Praiſe to the Creator.</p>
